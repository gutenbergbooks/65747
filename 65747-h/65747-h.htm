<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>There is no person in musical or general
history whose life can be studied by
young people with more advantage, or
followed in its general characteristics with
more profit than Johann Sebastian Bach. The
old saying that genius is only the highest capacity
for work has sometimes been attributed to him.
Whether he originated the saying or not, his life
illustrates its truth. His industry was astonishing,
whether in adverse or prosperous circumstances,
though his remuneration, considering the magnitude
of his achievements, now seems a beggarly pittance.
He worked for the highest in his art, and always
with the utmost of his ability, and consecrated his
work to the divine honor. Upon all his important
pieces he inscribed the letters, &ldquo;S. D. G.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Soli
Deo Gloria&rdquo;), &ldquo;to the glory of God alone.&rdquo; What
the simple, God-fearing, art-loving cantor of Saint
Thomas accomplished, the world knows. Gounod
summed it up in the declaration that if all the
music written since Bach&rsquo;s time were lost, it could
be reconstructed upon what he wrote. His life
was as noble as his music. He was an affectionate
father, laboring manfully and incessantly to support
his large family; a good citizen, faithfully fulfilling
his duties and commanding universal respect; a
musician without an equal in the profundity of his
knowledge and the richness of his productions; the
founder of modern music, the master of the organ,
the composer of the highest forms of sacred music;
a plain, humble man, despising rank and show,
making no boast of his grand achievements, and
yet recognized in the court of Frederick the Great
as above courtiers and nobility by the title of his
genius. &ldquo;Seest thou a man diligent in business;
he shall stand before kings.&rdquo; He was a self-reliant,
self-sustained, evenly poised man, plain and
unostentatious in his bearing, honorable in his intercourse
with men, strong and unvarying in his home
love, and guided in every event of life by a strict
morality born of sincere religion. He followed the
bent of his genius untrammelled by the accidents
or troubles of life, and sought for no higher reward
than his own conviction of the worth of his accomplishments.
Such a life is to be commended
not only to the young student entering upon the
profession of music, but to every young person
entering upon the duties of life. This little volume,
therefore, worthily claims a place among &ldquo;Life
Stories for Young People.&rdquo; Though the original
is inaccurate in some small details, which later
biographers have corrected, the general story of his
life is reliable and nearly every event of importance
is included in its pages.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">A Friend in Need</span></h2>
<p>At the close of a beautiful Summer day,
in the year 1699, subdued and solemn
strains of music from the little house
of the organist of the market-town of
Ohrdruff<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> floated through its quiet streets. A boy
sat crying upon the stone steps leading to the
house-door. Now and then he lifted his head,
looked into the hallway, and saying in a mournfully
complaining tone, &ldquo;False again,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;The second
violin plays most abominably,&rdquo; or making some
similar protest of musical sensibility, bowed his
head again in sorrow and tears.</p>
<p>As he sat thus, a quick step was heard coming up
the street. A lad, somewhat older than the other,
approached and said in a clear, cheerful voice:
&ldquo;Why are you crying, Bastian, and what means
this funeral music?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The one addressed raised his handsome eyes, red
with weeping, bowed in a dejected manner to his
questioner, and said in a low voice: &ldquo;My brother
is dead. Did you not know it?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not heard a word of it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;All
last week I was at my cousin&rsquo;s in Eisenach,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> and I
have but just returned. Is he dead? And so suddenly!
Poor boy, I pity you from my heart.
When did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last evening just about this time. He had
not been in his usual health for a week. He often
complained of dizziness and difficulty in breathing,
and yesterday while cleaning his old violin he
suddenly fell and died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passionate sobs made his last words almost unintelligible,
and the boy for a few seconds gave way
to irrepressible grief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>His young friend regarded him in silence for a
time, and when he had somewhat recovered from
his passionate sobbing delicately sought to divert
his attention from his troubles by asking, &ldquo;Who
are these playing so wretchedly? Friends of the
deceased?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of them are. They have engaged the
town clerk&rsquo;s assistant for second violin, and he plays
badly enough to set one&rsquo;s teeth on edge. If my
dead brother could hear him, he would jump out
of his coffin and drive the bungler out of his
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His friend smilingly nodded assent. &ldquo;He is
certainly a slovenly player, but it can&rsquo;t be helped
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; sobbed the boy.</p>
<p>A brief pause in the conversation was filled with
the tones of the funeral music, during which his
friend&rsquo;s gaze rested thoughtfully and sympathetically
upon the countenance of his mournful comrade, and
his lips moved as if he were talking to himself.
At last he resumed reluctantly, but with manifest
cordiality and good-will: &ldquo;Well, Bastian, what is
to be done now that your brother, the organist, is
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The town will install a new organist, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but that is of little consequence;
I mean what will become of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of me?&rdquo; replied Sebastian, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Who
can say? But with God&rsquo;s help I will become a
skilful musician, like my good father, and as all the
Bachs have been for a hundred years past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mistake my question,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;I
mean where will you live now that this house is
henceforth to be closed? You are now a poor
orphan. Do you expect that any of your relatives
will take you in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sebastian shook his head. &ldquo;No, Erdmann,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> I
do not. Who can do it? My only remaining
brother, Johann Jakob, has left the country and
gone into business in Sweden. Both my uncles,
my father&rsquo;s brothers, have been dead for some
years, and my cousins have trouble enough to get
along upon their small chorister&rsquo;s allowance without
being burdened with me. Again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be very hard for you, my poor Bastian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sebastian for a moment regarded his sympathetic
friend with moistened eyes, then cordially took his
arm and went slowly down the street with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you about this, Erdmann; they possibly
may look at the matter differently. The relatives
will come to the funeral ceremonies in the
morning, and it may be perhaps that this or that
one will take me in until something definite can be
arranged; but I am not sure that I wish them to do
so. How could I be happy? These poor people
have no higher ambition than to get musical education
enough to fit them for an ordinary organist&rsquo;s
position and enable them to secure a place in
some Thuringian country town, and, when they
get it, to go on, day after day, practising noble
music as if it were a trade, just as if they were
cobblers or tailors. If I were to find a home with
cousins Tobias Friedrich, Johann Bernhard, Johann
Christoph, or Johann Heinrich, what would become
of me? All my life I should hear only the music I
made myself. I should make no progress, I should
never penetrate the noble mysteries of our art; I
should remain a town musician like a thousand
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Bastian, why should you trouble yourself
about these matters? Why fix a goal for yourself
now? You are still very young.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am old enough to know that I must escape
from this narrow musical life. Even if my brother
had lived, I should not have remained with him
much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? He was a skilful musician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but only for himself. He either could not
or would not assist me to advance. I was disgusted
with his dry and uninteresting exercises, and he
refused to let me practise more useful and difficult
ones. He had a manuscript volume of piano
studies by famous masters, like Froberger, Fischer,
Kerl, Pachelbel, Buxtehude, Bruhns, and B&ouml;hm&mdash;valuable
works, I assure you. Do you suppose
he allowed me to have them? When I begged for
the volume, he refused me and locked it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is strange. Why should he have acted
so? He could not possibly keep you from advancing
in the art for which you have such decided
talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. He could do well for himself,
like all the old organists round here, but he had not
the faculty of making others progress. There is
something forbidding and mysterious in the attitude
of these old musicians of this stamp, which makes
it very difficult for beginners to acquire even the
rudiments.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is curious; but did you at last secure those
beautiful and difficult musical exercises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An arch smile lit up Sebastian&rsquo;s countenance,
immediately followed by an indignant expression:
&ldquo;It is a sad story, Erdmann, and it makes me feel
angry whenever I think of it. But listen. My
brother had locked up the manuscript in a cabinet
which did not shut very closely. I determined to
get it, for otherwise I should remain an ignorant
scholar and make no advance. One night, when
my brother was asleep, I squeezed my hands&mdash;they
are so little&mdash;between the wires of the cabinet
and pulled the roll out, not, however, without
rubbing the skin off my hands pretty badly, and
carried my treasure safely away to my little chamber,
where, as I had no candle, I copied the whole
book by moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you little sinner,&rdquo; said Erdmann, laughing
and amazed, &ldquo;I call that perseverance. How long
did it take you to copy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fully six months, and my eyes are weak in
consequence. And after this what do you suppose
happened? One day my brother came in, unawares,
when I had the exercises, and without saying
by your leave carried off my precious treasure.
He never brought it back, notwithstanding all my
tearful entreaties.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Erdmann. &ldquo;Worse than
dreadful! How could he do it? I should have
hated him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! He is still my brother. He has done
me many kindnesses, and I am greatly distressed,&rdquo;
his voice trembled again, &ldquo;greatly distressed at his
death, and just as he was cleaning the old violin!
He believed it was a genuine Amati and insisted that
Antonio Amati&rsquo;s name and symbols were pasted on
it in my grandfather&rsquo;s time, but I do not believe it.
The tone is much too hard and rasping. I think
it is an old Tyrolean country violin.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Will he be buried to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then your fate must be decided?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly it must. The cousins then must give
me my copy of the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to do that at least. But tell me,
what else must they give you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall only claim what belongs to me. On an
upper shelf in the cabinet there is a tin box with
my christening-money, two medals inherited from
my great-uncle, Heinrich, and a little money left
me by my good father, which they must give me,
must they not, Erdmann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. You are certainly very young
yet, Bastian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young!&rdquo; replied the latter, indignantly. &ldquo;I am
thirteen&mdash;almost fourteen years old. It is high
time I was learning something useful, hearing good
music, becoming acquainted with great compositions,
and I cannot do that here or elsewhere in Thuringia.
I must go to some great city where the musical life
is intense, where famous organists delight congregations
on Sunday, and public libraries lend their best
books. It is for such reasons as these I cannot
stay with my cousins, even if they should cordially
invite me. Now, do you understand, Erdmann?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>During this statement his friend had been thoughtfully
regarding the little Sebastian&mdash;he was very small
for his age&mdash;and at last tenderly said: &ldquo;I believe
you are right, Sebastian. Were you to remain here
you would be in wretched circumstances like all the
other Bachs, although they have musical talent by
nature. You must get away, and I will make you
this proposition: Day after to-morrow I am going
to see my mother&rsquo;s brother at L&uuml;neburg.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> Go with
me. L&uuml;neburg is not a great city, but it is a much
more important place than Ohrdruff, Arnstadt, or
Eisenach. It was for long the residence of the
Grand Duke of Brunswick, and it still has many of
the advantages of a capital. There is a magnificent
organ in the old Gothic Church of St. John, and
every Sunday you can hear the best of music there.
You would enjoy that, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sebastian stood for a moment with glistening eyes,
overcome with joy. &ldquo;L&uuml;neburg!&rdquo; he replied with
trembling voice, &ldquo;St. John&rsquo;s Church organ! Oh,
Erdmann, the great organist B&ouml;hm,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> whose majestic
chorales I copied by moonlight, is the leading player
there. Oh, to hear him, to hear him, I would go
barefoot to L&uuml;neburg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Erdmann, pleased with the acceptance
of his proposal, &ldquo;that will be nice for you, and
a few miles from there is Hamburg.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where the famous Reinken, Johann Adam
Reinken,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> plays splendidly at St. Katherine&rsquo;s
Church,&rdquo; interposed Sebastian, with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Erdmann, my dear Erdmann, I must go; and if
you will take me with you I will thank you all my
life long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your relatives consent, I shall not fail to
do so,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;And once you are in
L&uuml;neburg, my uncle, if I ask him, will gladly help
you to go farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Sebastian, overcome with delight.
&ldquo;Oh, dear friend, how fortunate I am to have met
you! I am determined to go with you whether my
cousins consent or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His more considerate friend advised him to keep
on good terms with his relatives. &ldquo;I will come in
the morning and inquire,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Only be very
judicious, so that they may have confidence in your
good judgment and give their consent to your
plans.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will. But come, be sure to come,&rdquo; implored
Sebastian, in a beseeching tone, as he pressed
his friend&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;And not too late. The funeral
takes place immediately after the noon service, and
promptly afterward everything necessary must be
done, for most of the guests will wish to leave
before evening, so that they may be punctual at
their posts on Monday morning. There will not
be much time to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. The procession passes our
house and I can then fix the time. Leave it all
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will do so, dear Erdmann, and already I
give you a thousand thanks. It seems as if a new
life were opening for me. Oh! Oh! to hear B&ouml;hm
play, and perhaps even Reinken, and to hear their
works and play them! Could anything be finer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied his friend, endeavoring to moderate
his enthusiasm, &ldquo;the world has much besides
this that is worth living for. But it is nice that you
are pleased with your prospects. Doing things by
halves will not accomplish much of any value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shall never be said of me,&rdquo; interposed
Sebastian, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;I feel that I can accomplish
something of value, but I must do it in
the right way and in the right place&mdash;in L&uuml;neburg.
L&uuml;neburg is now my watchword. I shall not shut
eyes this night. Would it were morning!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have patience. The morning will not fail
you. So now, <i>auf wiedersehen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye. I will hurry home to pack my
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the friends separated in the twilight, in the
narrow streets of Ohrdruff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">In the World</span></h2>
<p>The funeral of the organist and music
master, Johann Christoph Bach, was
marked by all the ceremony becoming
the burial of an excellent man, a faithful
servant of the church and school, and an accomplished
musician. The mourners returned from the
churchyard, speaking with subdued voices. They
were plain, earnest men, clad in simple black coats,
long-skirted waistcoats over short knee-breeches and
stockings, and buckled shoes. They also wore the
three-pointed hat over a small periwig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Arrived at the house, those not belonging to the
family took their departure after a few words of
condolence, but the relatives entered and assembled
in the sitting-room of the deceased around the old
black family-table, which had been made ready for
such business as it might be necessary for them to
settle before they separated. This did not take
long. The joint bequest, very moderate in amount,
fell to the five sons of the deceased, to be divided at
a fitting time. The principal difficulty was to decide
as to the further care and education of the
little Johann Sebastian; but they were spared any
trouble on his account, for they had hardly begun
to consider the question when Sebastian, who had
been sitting in the window looking at the funeral
hymn, arose, and decorously advanced to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear cousins,&rdquo; he boldly began, looking round
the circle with large, bright eyes, &ldquo;do not trouble
yourselves about me. I am in my fourteenth year
and am old enough to take care of myself hereafter.
I thank my dead brother for all the love and kindness
which he bestowed upon me to the very end,
but I am not willing longer to be a burden to anyone;
I shall leave this good home as early as possible
to-morrow to seek my fortunes elsewhere. I beg
you to give me the organ compositions which Johann
Christoph took away from me, likewise the old box
with my christening-money, together with your
blessing, and let me go in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>All present were greatly astonished at the boy&rsquo;s
bold little speech, and there was silence in the room
for a time. It was broken by the most prominent
one in the circle, Johann Valentin, eldest son of
George Christoph, cantor at Schweinfurt, who said:
&ldquo;Your statement greatly astonishes us, dear Johann
Sebastian; you are not yet of age nor able to earn a
living by the practice of our beloved music. Tell
us what your plans are and how you expect to support
yourself. Your little christening-money will
not go far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first move will be to the city of L&uuml;neburg,&rdquo;
said the boy, with confidence, &ldquo;where I hope to take
lessons from the great organist, B&ouml;hm. My friend
Erdmann, who has a kind uncle living there, goes
to him to-morrow, and will take me with him and
introduce me to him. I have a good singing voice
and an excellent method, so I expect I shall easily
secure a position as chorister and thus provide for
the ordinary expenses of life. In case of extreme
need, my friend Erdmann has promised me his
uncle&rsquo;s assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Johann Valentin replied: &ldquo;Our family, honorably
known as the Bachs, are of a contented spirit
by nature, and have always been so well satisfied
with their fatherland and their circumstances that,
with the exception of your brother, Johann Jakob,
none of them until now has desired to seek service
and fortune outside of Thuringia. The Bachs
until now have considered the approbation of their
superiors and of their native places as more desirable
than the quest for fame at great trouble and
expense among jealous strangers. Are you now to
be an exception, dear Johann Sebastian? Do you
not believe one can become a good organist here,
one well pleasing to God and man, and live here
contented with his position? Your good father,
Johann Ambrosius, I think, set you a commendable
example. How is it then that you alone have this
restlessness and this inordinate desire to associate
with so-called &lsquo;great musicians&rsquo;? Oh, my dear
Johann Sebastian, music is not a mere matter
of show and glory; it is a solemn reality. It is of
little consequence whether the world hears of us, so
that we strive with all our might that God may
hear us and recognize our simple art.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you say, cousin,&rdquo; replied Sebastian, with
an earnestness not often found in one so young, &ldquo;is
as true as gold, and yet I cannot longer remain
satisfied with what our family has thus far accomplished.
What I mean is, that the Bachs should not
continuously learn only from the Bachs. They
must go out into the world. Every master craftsman
lets his son go among strangers so that he may
learn some other master&rsquo;s style and ways, and thus
improve, or, as it were, bring fresh blood into his
workmanship. Painters and sculptors go to Italy,
where there are good masters and teachers, and infuse
new life into their artistic work at home; while
musicians alone sit immovable in their little organ-lofts
and hear no one but themselves. There is no
progress in that. And it is because I believe all this
that I am determined to travel and try to study in
other places and among other people, to hear good
musicians, and to learn from them what I need to
learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes glistened and his cheeks reddened
as he spoke. He grew more and more excited as
he proceeded, until at last he was well-nigh breathless.
Finally, he ceased and looked around the circle,
awaiting a gracious answer. But the cousins were
also silent, and looked at each other as if paralyzed
by the boy&rsquo;s passionate utterances, until at last
Johann Ernst, Johann Christoph&rsquo;s eldest son, expressed
the sentiment of the family, and said, in a
tone of the deepest conviction, &ldquo;It is only pride and
the craving for empty honors that have induced
you to leave here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is not so,&rdquo; replied Sebastian, excitedly.
&ldquo;I am striving for the same ends as you, only in
my own way. If I master my art, I will elevate
and improve sacred music in a worthy and judicious
manner; I will play for the praise of the Lord. I
will walk honestly, as did my blessed father. If I
seek other ends than these may someone shatter
my instrument, for I shall no longer be worthy to
touch the consecrated keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no longer a boy who spoke, but a young
man, who had seriously considered his art and who
was determined nothing should turn him from the
right way to the highest achievements.</p>
<p>As such a youth the Bachs at last recognized
him. After a whispered consultation the eldest
voiced the final decision: &ldquo;We have agreed, dear
Johann Sebastian, to let you go the way you have
chosen, hoping and praying it may end well; we
have the utmost confidence in the sincerity of your
purpose, and as for the rest we leave you in the Almighty&rsquo;s
hands. Forget not, among strangers, who
you are and where you belong. We, the elders,
will remain here, and when you return to the dear
Thuringian land, come as a true Bach, as an able
and pious musician, as a worthy son of your brave,
faithful father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you all solemnly to do so,&rdquo; said
Sebastian, with deep emotion, as he extended his
hand to each cousin, beginning with Valentin. They
shook it warmly and firmly, as a mark of conciliation,
and then Johann Valentin took a gulden from
his little purse, as did all the others, and handed the
modest sum to the blushing boy as his travel-money.
They also gave him the tin savings-box with the
christening-money, and beside this his well-earned
manuscript, an autograph motet<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> of his dead brother&rsquo;s
(&ldquo;Lord, if I have only Thee&rdquo;) for five voices, with
the fundamental bass, and finally added to his
brother&rsquo;s bequest a violin (not the supposed Amati),
as well as the bow and case, so that the little
traveller &ldquo;may have the opportunity further to perfect
himself on this instrument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they dismissed the boy, who was overcome
with joy and gratitude, to give him time to make
his simple plans for the journey. He rushed out
as if beside himself with happiness, which was still
further intensified by the appearance of his true
friend Erdmann at the door, whom he embraced
without any regard to the parcels in his arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Erdmann, dearest Erdmann,&rdquo; he shouted,
scarcely lowering his voice, &ldquo;I am free! I am
going with you, God be praised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they really let you go, and with their
free consent?&rdquo; said the astonished Erdmann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With their free consent,&rdquo; replied Sebastian.
&ldquo;At first they hesitated. They thought it improper
for a Bach to go among strangers and to wish to
study with other masters, but I argued so stoutly
against that view, and defended my plans so earnestly,
that at last they trusted me and gave their
consent with many good wishes. They also contributed
an ample sum of travel-money, and gave
me this violin and a composition as a remembrance
of my dead brother,&mdash;but, oh, I could have remembered
him without that.&rdquo; And the great spiritual
eyes of the boy glistened with rising emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now all goes well,&rdquo; said Erdmann. &ldquo;Your
cousins have taken the right view of the case. You
are free, and nothing can prevent you from becoming
a great musician&mdash;greater than all the Bachs,
big and little, before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried Sebastian, trembling with joy;
&ldquo;but when shall we start?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing in the morning. We have a
good conveyance to Gotha and day after to-morrow
to M&uuml;hlhausen. Bring your baggage this evening
to the Black Bear and be there yourself to-morrow
morning at sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Sebastian, excitedly. His
outcry rang so loudly through the house that one
of the Bach cousins opened the door and reproved
him: &ldquo;Johann Sebastian, we are still in the house
of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said the really contrite lad, turning
crimson, as he started up to his little chamber,
while Erdmann, taking some of the reproof to himself,
quietly withdrew.</p>
<p>Thus the memorable day came to an end crowning
Sebastian&rsquo;s dearest wishes. His joy could hardly
have been greater had he been vouchsafed a glance
into the future and realized he was taking the first
step upon the road leading him to the supreme
heights of his art.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>With eager hands he joyfully packed the little
bag left him by his devoted father with his scanty
stock of clothes and the necessary books and papers,
and took it in the darkness of the evening to the
Black Bear, where the old and well-known house-servant
took care of it. Then he hastened back to
the organist&rsquo;s house, bade a cordial farewell to his
relatives, ate a little soup in the kitchen, made for
him by the old housemaid, took a big slice of
bread, and hurried up to his chamber so that he
might have a good night&rsquo;s rest and be ready for his
early start.</p>
<p>There was not much sleep for him, however, that
night. He lay upon his bed with wide-open eyes
looking out into the serene moonlight. Like the
light clouds which floated across the moon, memories
and hopes swept over his young soul. Gentle,
beautiful melodies entranced him and made his
heart beat exultantly. Half waking, half dreaming,
he raised his hands as though they touched the
keys of a celestial instrument and his lips murmured
disconnected words.</p>
<p>Thus the night hours passed between waking and
sleeping. Toward morning he sank into the deep,
sound sleep of youth, and notwithstanding his longings
and his impatience for the journey would have
slept beyond the appointed hour had not his trusty
friend, the old housemaid, awakened him and reminded
him of his purpose, at the first glow of
dawn. It was a joyful call. Thankfully he threw
his arms about her neck and drew her old head
down to his. Then he dismissed her, arose and
dressed, bathed his flushed face in cold water, and
repaired to the kitchen, where he sat by the maidservant
a few minutes while he ate his morning
soup.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>At last he was through. He bade farewell to his
tearful friend and was about to leave the house,
when a room door opened and the plain, honest
face of Johann Valentin appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johann Sebastian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boy stood before him, he placed both
hands upon his shoulders and looked into his clear
blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Johann Sebastian,&rdquo; he said with deep
emotion, &ldquo;my heart bids me say a word to you
before you leave your home. Some voice clearly
tells me that great achievements and fame are in
store for you. But whatever may be the outcome
of the course you take this day, contrary to the
usages and habits of our family, the greatest human
fame is as nothing in God&rsquo;s eyes if it is not humbly
received by a pure and pious heart, which
ascribes the honor to Him. Remember this, dear
Johann Sebastian, and take from me, the eldest of
the family, in place of your dear father, my heartiest
wishes and blessings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>He placed his hand upon the boy&rsquo;s head, whispered
a prayer, kissed him lightly upon the forehead,
and softly said, &ldquo;Now go in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not be disappointed in me, dear
cousin,&rdquo; said the boy with emotion, as he reverently
kissed the hand of his well-wisher. &ldquo;I shall never
forget your words, never, and never shall I cease to
be grateful for your fatherly kindness. Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s angels guide and guard you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment he had left the organist&rsquo;s
house and with weeping eyes was hastening down
the deserted street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The First Step to Fame</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning! It is well that you
are here at last, Sebastian,&rdquo; exclaimed Erdmann,
as he advanced to meet his friend.
&ldquo;The horses are already harnessed in
the yard and the driver has not had to wait long
for you. Come in at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the breathless boy; &ldquo;is my bag
put on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I took it to the wagon myself.
What is that slung on your back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own violin. My cousins gave it to me as
part of my brother&rsquo;s legacy. It was kind of them,
don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but now let us go in. The driver is taking
his morning beer in the kitchen and we must
make arrangements for our transportation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The two friends hastened in, and introduced
themselves to the honest Jehu, who received them
with a grunt of recognition. Then the young passengers
climbed into the wagon, a somewhat primitive
style of vehicle with a canvas cover stretched
over hoops, fixed a convenient place for themselves
and their luggage among some sacks of hay in the
back, and a few minutes later were rattling down the
quiet street with happy hearts, thence out through
the low, dark town-gate into the level country, which
was most attractive in the early morning light. On
every side the early-awakened birds were holding
jubilant matin service in the bushes and trees.</p>
<p>It was a delightful journey, notwithstanding the
rough country roads and the jolting wagon, for the
young travellers were in excellent spirits. They
rolled up the canvas cover and keenly enjoyed the
fresh beauty of the summer morning. Every village
they passed was a source of wonder, every cornfield
a delight to their eyes, every wood an unsurpassed
pleasure; with quick eyes they followed the flight of
every bird, and with attentive ears they listened to
every sound, nigh and far. They drank in the perfume
of the clover with zest. They even enjoyed
the bitter crab-apples, which they plucked as they
passed, as if they had been sweet dainties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>But now and then more serious feelings rose in
the hearts of the lads. As they were riding through
a country village a funeral procession crossed their
way, the mourners singing a chorale. Their joyous
chatter ceased. Erdmann sorrowfully regarded the
sad spectacle, but Sebastian took his violin from his
case and played a beautiful accompaniment to the
chorale.</p>
<p>They talked almost ceaselessly of their past
and of the future, but the city of L&uuml;neburg, the
end of their journey, was the principal theme of
conversation. Erdmann, who had previously been
in the old Hanse city, had to describe the place
over and over before his young companion&rsquo;s questions
were satisfied. Sebastian pictured it to himself
as the greatest and most imposing city he
had ever known, with ancient and beautifully decorated
gabled buildings, great shops and warehouses,
majestic churches and cloisters. As he listened to
Erdmann&rsquo;s description he fancied himself sailing up
and down the river, climbing the high Kalkberg to
the St. Michael&rsquo;s School, wandering through the
halls of the old Rathaus, going down into the
gypsum quarries near by, and wandering among
the leafy recesses of the G&ouml;hrde.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> In return for
Erdmann&rsquo;s delightful story, Sebastian related the
events of his early life at home and told of his
father&rsquo;s masterly skill in organ and violin playing.
The good-natured Erdmann listened to him with
deep or at least apparently deep interest, and volunteered
questions to bring out new information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly most extraordinary,&rdquo; said he,
when an opportunity offered itself, &ldquo;that a talent for
the same art should have appeared without a break
in one and the same family and in all its numerous
branches. It has already come to this, that they call
all skilful organists in Thuringia &lsquo;Bach,&rsquo; without
regard to their names, for all Bachs are skilful
organists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; replied Sebastian, &ldquo;and my blessed
father, Johann Ambrosius, was one of the most skilful
of them all. He inherited this gift from his
great-grandfather, Veit Bach<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>, who left Hungary for
Germany two centuries ago to enjoy religious liberty,
for he was a faithful adherent of the Lutheran
Church. He found this liberty in Thuringia, settled
down in the village of Wechmar, near Gotha, where
he opened its first bakery and practised music for his
own pleasure. He had learned it from the gypsies,
and played skilfully on the zither, a kind of lute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;And this Veit Bach,&rdquo; said Erdmann, smiling,
&ldquo;has transmitted his talent through his numerous
posterity to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he has,&rdquo; said Sebastian, with emphasis.
&ldquo;His son Hans gave up the bakery and was apprenticed
to the town-piper of Gotha. He lived at
that time in the tall tower of the old guildhall and
there Hans fiddled and piped in the jolliest way. It
is said he was a &lsquo;hail-fellow-well-met,&rsquo; and welcome
everywhere. My father had a picture of him playing
the violin, with a large bell on his left shoulder.
Under it is written:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Here you see, fiddling, stands Hans Bach,</p>
<p class="t0">To hear him play would make you laugh.</p>
<p class="t0">He plays, you must know, in a way of his own,</p>
<p class="t0">And wears a fine beard by which he is known.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Erdmann laughed loudly. &ldquo;He must have been
a queer fellow,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He would have suited
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to have suited anyone,&rdquo; said Sebastian.
&ldquo;His musical talent descended to his three
sons. Johann was organist at the church in Erfurt,
known as the &lsquo;Predige Church&rsquo;; Christoph, my
grandfather, died as a member of the Arnstadt
town band; and Heinrich as town organist, also in
Arnstadt. The family tendency was so strong in
him, my father used to say, that even as a boy he
would run miles to hear an organ played and to
learn something. All three of these have composed
some excellent music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is remarkable,&rdquo; said Erdmann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Johann as well as Heinrich had three
sons. All six became musicians, and their children
and grandchildren after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would have believed it? It is astonishing!
Now tell me about your good father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was truly a distinguished musician. The
people of Eisenach thoroughly appreciated their
Court and town musician. His resemblance to his
twin brother, Johann Christoph, was remarkable.
My mother has often told me that she and her
sister-in-law could not have told them apart when
they were together but for their dress. They were
also wonderfully alike in disposition, speech, gait,
and sentiments. They were exactly similar in the
style and execution of their music, also. When
one of them was sick the other was, and they died
almost at the same time. Is it not both beautiful
and touching?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is so. You Bachs are indeed a peculiar
family. Take care, Bastian, that you also prove a
worthy member of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope so. You may be sure I shall work
hard for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus chatting with each other and enjoying the
journey with all the zest and enthusiasm of youth,
the lads reached Gotha, and after a quiet night&rsquo;s rest
at a modest inn went on to M&uuml;hlhausen. Thence
they continued their journey on foot, now and then
getting a ride when anyone was kind enough to
pick them up. Their luggage had been intrusted
by the practical Erdmann to a business house which
had relations with L&uuml;neburg and undertook to forward
it to his uncle&rsquo;s well-known house.</p>
<p>After seven days&rsquo; travelling they reached L&uuml;neburg
fresh and happy, and were received by Erdmann&rsquo;s
uncle with that cordial and friendly hospitality
which his nephew had anticipated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Sebastian quickly made a good impression upon
the old gentleman, especially by his precocity and
the intelligence which shone in his attractive eyes.
The impression changed to one of respectful admiration
when, a few days after their arrival, he seated
himself at the old gentleman&rsquo;s fine Silbermann
piano<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> and played his favorite chorale (&ldquo;All is well,
O Friend of my Soul&rdquo;), which abounds in characteristic
harmony, beautiful modulation, and rich
melody. He promised to use his influence in
getting him a position in the choir of the St.
Michael&rsquo;s School, and he kept his word. On the
very next day the stately old gentleman waited
upon the Rector of the school, and stated the purpose
of his visit so enthusiastically that the latter
smilingly gave his assent and arranged with the
leader of the choir that Johann Sebastian should
have a trial of his voice in his presence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The boy stood the test so well that the old choir-leader
declared he was a most valuable acquisition.
His voice was sonorous and of fine quality, strong
and of good range, and beside this he read everything
at sight and displayed such a remarkable
knowledge of counterpoint that the Rector and
leader were alike astonished. The former assigned
him a room near his own and he was given a position
as soprano singer, or discantist, in the choir
as well as a seat at the free table<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> of the school.
Sebastian&rsquo;s dearest wish was now gratified, and on
the same day, after cordially thanking his benefactor,
he settled down in the St. Michael&rsquo;s School,
occupying a modest little room in a wing, with
three other pleasant discantist companions.</p>
<p>Thenceforth he had to be industrious, very industrious,
for it was only by extraordinary effort
that he could retain the advantage of the free
position, and only by unusual industry that he could
save time enough from school duties to gratify his
musical inclinations. The St. Michael&rsquo;s School at
that time had an abundance of the richest material,
which was accessible to him. In a chapel at the
side of the school there was a fine little organ, upon
which he was occasionally allowed to play after he
had demonstrated his ability to do so. There was
also a rich collection of old musical manuscripts, in
which he could revel to his heart&rsquo;s content whenever
he had the time. Beside these, there were old
and well-preserved instruments, violins, violas, violoncellos,
lutes, etc. Had it only been permissible
he would gladly have devoted his nights to the
acquisition of the contents of these treasures, as he
once had done in Ohrdruff; but nothing prevented
his use of them in the daytime, and he was as happy
as a king when he could lose himself in a flood of
the old masters&rsquo; harmonies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Only one thing troubled him. He could not
often improve and strengthen his organ-playing by
listening to the great players. Ordinarily it was
only possible to hear B&ouml;hm, the famous organist,
on Sundays, and at such times Sebastian was confined
to the church of the school by his duties as
discantist, and other opportunities to hear him were
so rare that there was little prospect of his gratifying
his desire to listen to the master&rsquo;s richly flowing
melodies, without making extra exertion. So he
inquired of the sexton and organ-blower of St.
John&rsquo;s Church when the great artist played on week
days in the always closed church. Then, with the
gracious connivance of the organ-blower, to whom
he paid many a shilling out of his small store, he
would slip into the church, ascend the tower into
the loft, and there, resting upon his knees near an
opening, would listen with trembling, delighted
heart to the now lovely, again powerful, but always
devout playing of the master. He paid careful
attention to every nuance, to every peculiar method
of tone production, and to the style of performance,
so as to fix them in his memory. When the playing
was over he would rush back to his room, take
out the compositions of B&ouml;hm, which he had once
copied with such infinite care and trouble, and pore
over them as if the pieces which he had just heard
had been brought to him by B&ouml;hm himself for
performance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>He also cultivated violin-playing to the best of
his ability, and with the help of his extraordinary
natural gifts entered so deeply into the real nature
of this simple yet marvellously expressive instrument
that even with his still imperfect technic he
produced the finest quality of tone, and when he
extemporized seemed to be holding a dialogue with
his own genius.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Many a time in the evening, when his roommates
had sought their beds and all was silent in the large
halls, he would spend hours in the moonlight, walking
up and down the little room, lightly using his bow,
and softly singing the second part to the melody
he was playing, greatly to the delight and astonishment
of the boys, while he himself was as happy as
if he were living in a higher and serener sphere.</p>
<p>About this time a peculiar change took place in
his beautiful voice. As he was singing one day in
the choir, he heard himself involuntarily singing as
it were with a double voice&mdash;in soprano and in a
lower octave&mdash;to the great surprise of the leader and
not less to his own consternation. His consternation
increased when he realized during the next few
weeks that he could neither speak nor sing except
in octaves, and bitter was his sorrow when he found
that this condition, instead of disappearing, speedily
grew worse, and that his beautiful voice was gone
forever. He wept piteously and moaned: &ldquo;Alas!
now I can only be half a musician through life, for
my highest and noblest instrument is ruined and
can never be replaced.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Beside his grief over the loss of this beautiful
divine gift, he was now troubled with painful solicitude
as to his immediate future. It was solely on
account of his accomplishments as a discantist in
the choir that he had enjoyed the great privilege
of the free position in the school. What would
happen were this to be taken away from him?
What would become of his musical and general
education? Utter despair overcame his strong,
vigorous spirit. &ldquo;What will become of me? What
will become of me?&rdquo; he bitterly ejaculated. His
pale, anxious face showed his severe troubles.</p>
<p>One day the Rector of the school unexpectedly
summoned him, and to his great delight and surprise
informed him that, owing to the loss of his
singing-voice, he would be relieved from his duties
as discantist; but in consideration of his industry
and good conduct, also of the unusual musical gifts
with which nature had endowed him, he would continue
to enjoy the privileges of free scholarship,
and that he had suggested him to the leader of
the choir as an assistant in the instruction of the
younger pupils in music.</p>
<p>Who ever was happier than Sebastian? He
fervently thanked the Rector for his kindness, reverently
kissed his hand, and hastened away with a
joyous heart.</p>
<p>One day his friend Erdmann, who had been on a
visit to his father in Hamburg, returned and told
him of his experiences. &ldquo;Upon one occasion, a
church festival, at which the renowned organist,
Reinken, played, I wished with all my heart, dear
Sebastian, that you were there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you have heard him?&rdquo; said Sebastian,
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and for a whole hour. That was playing
for you! I never have heard the like of it. Everyone
was excited. Women wept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he play?&rdquo; asked Sebastian, breathlessly
and with his very soul in his eyes, as he looked
at his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First a magnificent prelude<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> for full organ in
E major, preceding an artistic fugued chorale of
wonderful beauty (&lsquo;We all believe in one God&rsquo;),
and at the close a fantasia on &lsquo;Jesus, my Joy.&rsquo;
Oh, if you only could have heard it, Sebastian!
He can play much more beautifully and skilfully
than B&ouml;hm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sebastian was completely self-absorbed. &ldquo;I must
hear him,&rdquo; he said at last, fixing his gaze upon his
friend. &ldquo;I must, I must, even if I have to give
up everything here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is not at all necessary,&rdquo; quietly replied
the less impulsive Erdmann. &ldquo;If you apply in
the regular way they will give you leave of absence
for Sunday and Monday. Then you can easily go
to Hamburg on Saturday afternoon, which is your
free time, and get back again on Monday after
hearing Reinken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do it. Oh, I will do it, the very first
thing to-morrow morning. God grant they may
not refuse me permission; I will even go to
extremes to secure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, but don&rsquo;t dash your head against the
wall,&rdquo; said Erdmann. &ldquo;There is time enough for
you to hear Reinken even if you do not go next
Sunday. He will live to be a hundred years old.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Sebastian did not hear his last words. So intense
was his longing to go that he lost no time in asking
permission from the leader of the choir, and finally
obtained it with the aid of the Rector.</p>
<p>After dinner on Saturday he sped away with flying
feet and began his long twenty-five miles&rsquo; journey
to Hamburg. He reached the city late in the day,
very tired, hungry, and thirsty, but determined not
to miss Reinken&rsquo;s playing early in the morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>He found quarters for the night at a modest
inn, but he slept restlessly. He awoke, however,
refreshed, his fatigue having disappeared. He was
prompt at the early service, and found a seat among
the first-comers to St. Katherine&rsquo;s Church, where
he waited with fast-beating heart the first tones of
the majestic instrument from the hands of the great
master.</p>
<p>And now, now the first tone rose, like the first
rays of dawn, undulating, palpitating, rising and
falling, and then streaming out in a mighty tone-flood,
vivifying and uplifting the hearts of the
listeners. Truly it was the playing of the supreme
master, the art of perfect organ-playing and great
contrapuntal skill, the ideal which had so long
filled the soul of this gifted boy. He determined
to strive for like perfection with all his powers and
with absolute devotion to the work. In that
sacred place, where the highest revelations of art
had been made clear to him, he vowed to himself
he would never be satisfied with any lower standard,
he would never be contented with any less degree
of mastery of the sublime and exalted craft of
music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The New Life</span></h2>
<p>An unexpected opportunity being offered
to hear the famous organist again after
Sunday, Sebastian had no scruples against
remaining a few days longer in Hamburg.
He returned to L&uuml;neburg on Wednesday in such a
musical exaltation that he gave no thought to the
possible consequences of his violation of duty. No
reproaches, no penalties, however, could disturb him.
He had secured treasures that forevermore elevated
him above the petty, common things of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Though he had lived very economically during
his prolonged stay in Hamburg, he had so far exhausted
his little means that he began the return
journey with only a few <i>pfennigs</i> in his pocket.
Notwithstanding his youthful strength and endurance,
he was soon well-nigh exhausted. Unable
longer to endure the pangs of hunger, he stopped
at an inn on the highway to ask for such food as
his small means would purchase. A travelling carriage
with four beautiful black horses was standing
before the door. Inside there was lively commotion,
for they were preparing breakfast for the distinguished
travelling party. Sebastian stole quietly
into the house and asked the inn-keeper, who was
bustling about the coffee-room in a state of great
excitement, for a herring (the favorite food of the
poor in Thuringia) and a piece of bread, but no
attention was paid to him. Puffed up with pride
at serving such distinguished guests, he contemptuously
ignored the young traveller, and when the
request was repeated, refused it and turned him
away hungry from the door.</p>
<p>Sebastian was so deeply grieved and hurt by this
treatment he could hardly muster up courage to resume
his tramp upon an empty stomach. His
strength was well-nigh exhausted. He sat down on
the turf before the door, half determined not to
leave until the inn-keeper gave him food. He was
sick at heart and discouraged. Suddenly a window
was opened above him, and upon looking up he
espied a kind-faced old gentleman, who threw a
little parcel into the grass in front of him, accompanying
the act with a cordial and significant nod
of his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Sebastian was at first somewhat embarrassed.
Then he picked up the little parcel, undid the fine
white-paper wrapper, and two herrings and two nice
little rolls dropped out. Deeply moved by the
gift thus sent to him and casting a thankful glance
at the window, he took out his pocket-knife and
began to cut up one of the herrings. To his extreme
surprise he found a Holland ducat in the
fish. He took the second herring, and his surprise
was increased when he found another. Perplexed
and greatly agitated, he again gratefully gazed up at
the window, where his kind benefactor significantly
shook his powdered head and then disappeared behind
the curtains. Strengthened afresh by the herrings
and rolls and encouraged by this pleasant
incident on the last day of his long march, the happy
boy set out again; but he saved his ducats for the
next repetition of his musical pilgrimage to Hamburg.</p>
<p>His offence was expiated by a slight restriction of
his privileges, but it in no way affected the good-will
or respect of his teachers. They regarded the
liberty he had taken as a concession which was due to
his genius, and continued to allow him the free school
privileges in consideration of his industry and scholarly
gifts. They realized already his great future.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Sebastian&rsquo;s unknown benefactor</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>During his three years&rsquo; stay in L&uuml;neburg, Sebastian
by resistless determination and tireless industry rose
step by step in all his studies as well as in his
musical education, secured the requisite certificate
for the University, and the highest recognition as
violinist, organist, cembalist,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> and contrapuntist,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> and
as a youth of exemplary character. Hence there
was no question of his fitness for the position which
was now offered him through the influence of some
of his Thuringian friends, that of violinist in the
ducal chapel at Weimar.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>It was not without deep emotion that he left the
old school, the good Rector, the leader of the choir,
and his classmates and friends. He bade Erdmann&rsquo;s
kindly uncle a cordial farewell and left an affectionate
letter for Erdmann himself, who had quit L&uuml;neburg
and gone into business with his father, urging him
to correspond with him. On a cloudy spring morning
of 1703 the seventeen-year-old lad, head and
heart full of highest resolutions and aspirations,
passed through the gates of L&uuml;neburg on his way
to his new duties.</p>
<p>It seemed to Sebastian, who had never concealed
nor lost his love for the Thuringian land, that in
going to Weimar he was going home, and it was
with a genuine home feeling that he regarded his
modest little room with its outlook over garden and
field to the far mountain lines of the Thuringian
forest. He made himself at home there at once
with his violin and music, and entered upon the
duties of his position without delay. They were
simple enough for one who had gained perfect facility
by three years of tireless practice, but they were
far from satisfying his ambition; for the Court had
no higher ambition than to keep up a certain musical
state with which he had no sympathy. He
compensated himself for his part in this superficial
&ldquo;kling-klang&rdquo; by arranging with the old cathedral
organist to play for a pittance. On such occasions
he gave full expression to his feelings and conceptions
upon the powerful instrument, after the
manner of B&ouml;hm and Reinken, and lifted the souls
of those who listened breathlessly to his wonderful
playing above all earthly things. It seemed as if
the Reformation spirit inspired those tones, so full
of religious exaltation, and stirred the dingy portraits
of Luther, Melancthon, and Johann Friedrich.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The recognition of Sebastian&rsquo;s success was not
confined to Weimar and its people. It spread
throughout Thuringia, and the &ldquo;Duke&rsquo;s young
violinist&rdquo; had scarcely been in service six months
before he was invited by the Schwartzburg Consistory
to take the position of organist at the &ldquo;New
Church&rdquo; at Arnstadt, formerly known as St.
Boniface Church. He was greatly moved by the
invitation. The old city of Arnstadt had been the
home of Bachs for many generations. There his
great-uncle Heinrich had lived and labored, as well
as his father&rsquo;s twin-brother Johann Christoph, who
so strikingly resembled him that it seemed to Sebastian
he was now following in his dear father&rsquo;s steps.
How could such an invitation help making him
happy?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>There was another thing that induced him to accept
this invitation. The &ldquo;New Church&rdquo; was built
upon the site of the St. Boniface Church, which
was destroyed by fire in 1581, and was dedicated to
divine service in 1683. The beautiful church had
been without an organ twenty years, but one had
now been secured by contributions. The well-known
organ-builder, Johann Friedrich Wender, of M&uuml;hlhausen,
had constructed an excellent instrument,
and this was to be placed in charge of Johann Sebastian.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a>
Joyously he exulted at the prospect of releasing
its magical tones for the first time. He
accepted the position with a thousand thanks, notwithstanding
the small salary.</p>
<p>To add to his delight, several of his dear relatives
lived in Arnstadt. The situation and environs of
the place also were beautiful, and especially charming
to one of Sebastian&rsquo;s cheerful disposition. As
this was ample equivalent for the smallness of his
income, he accepted the annual salary of eighty
thalers, and went to Arnstadt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The slight demands which his position made
upon his time, left him leisure for the study of the
German and Old French contrapuntists. He labored
over their works most assiduously, to gain a more
thorough knowledge of the comprehensive rules of
the higher organ style. The better to express his
own conceptions, he also arranged some new violin
concertos of Vivaldi<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> for the piano, by which he
gained a clearer understanding of the relations of
musical ideas to each other and of the sequence of
modulations. What he wrote down during the day
without an instrument, he played over upon his
piano in the evening and sometimes late into the
night, until he had completely mastered the technic.</p>
<p>Beside all this, he assisted in the compilation of
the Freilighausen hymn-book, and for the purpose
of making the chorales more effective, he undertook
the arduous work of rearranging three hundred of
them and composing many new ones himself. His
organ-playing was so rich and fanciful in his own
conceptions that the congregation, accustomed as it
was to exceedingly simple hymn-accompaniments,
could not follow him, and this led to repeated complaints
from the Consistory. Sebastian, however,
striving only for the highest in his art, paid little
attention to them. He only labored all the harder
to perfect himself, ignored all practical matters, and
gave heed to no authority above him when it interfered
with the lofty purpose he had in view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>He found recreation after the fatigue of studies,
composition, and practice upon the violin, piano,
and organ, in the enjoyment of nature and in the
society of relatives and friends. Among the former
those most dear to him were the family of Johann
Michael, Heinrich&rsquo;s son, a quiet, music-loving
circle, the central attraction of which was the lovely,
blooming daughter, Maria Barbara, Sebastian&rsquo;s
studious and gifted pupil. Among his friends
those nearest to him were Christoph Uthe, the
minister of the &ldquo;New Church,&rdquo; and Johannes
Laurentius Stauber, assistant minister, both well-grounded
in the higher church music and entertaining
the utmost respect for Johann Sebastian&rsquo;s
courageous struggle and energetic will. In this circle
the young artist was particularly happy. There all
the real worth of his unpretentious life was displayed.
There he found warm appreciation for the
highest and best, and never failing help and sympathy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>One evening he rushed into the Bach home,
where both friends were visiting, and as if in utter
despair flung himself down into a chair without a
word of greeting. All looked at him with great
concern. &ldquo;Dear Bach,&rdquo; said Laurentius Stauber,
solicitously, &ldquo;why do you come rushing in in this
unceremonious manner? Has anything unfortunate
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the unfortunate myself,&rdquo; exclaimed Sebastian,
passionately. &ldquo;I am a bungler, and I shall
always be a bungler if I stay here. I am going
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away from here!&rdquo; they all exclaimed. &ldquo;Where
are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where there is something to be learned. I am
going backward here. Soon I shall know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sebastian&mdash;&rdquo; said Johann Michael, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is true,&rdquo; he replied, gloomily. &ldquo;My
organ-playing is going backward. It has no depth,
no vigor, no progressiveness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear Bach&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you it is true, I feel it. My compositions
also have no ideas. They show no charm of fancy,
no mastery of materials. This cannot go on any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you greatly underestimate yourself, cousin,&rdquo;
said Johann Ernst, son of the twin brother of
Sebastian&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;Would to God I could play
as well as you do already at twenty! Everyone
here is astonished at your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do they know about music here?&rdquo;
replied Sebastian, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are astonished also,&rdquo; interposed Herr
Uthe, &ldquo;and we think we know a little something
about sacred music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure you do,&rdquo; said Sebastian, &ldquo;but your
friendship for me makes you blind. You do not
see my failings. No, no, I must be off. I must
hear once more the great masters of the art and find
out from them how to get on the right road again.
I am going away at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you go? Where will you find
what you are longing for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Yes, that is the question,&rdquo; said
Sebastian, with a sad look in his eyes. &ldquo;Really
there are only two places where I expect to find
what I need&mdash;in Nuremberg with Pachelbel,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> or in
L&uuml;beck with Buxtehude.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Both are certainly far enough away from here,&rdquo;
said Herr Uthe, dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matters distance?&rdquo; answered Sebastian,
with some warmth. &ldquo;I would go to the ends of
the earth if I could hear the great organists there.
But, to cut matters short, I shall go to L&uuml;beck in
the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without permission?&rdquo; asked Johann Ernst,
very seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to see the Superintendent this
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at this unpleasant season of the year?
Think of that,&rdquo; said Johann Michael.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A journey of at least sixty miles,&rdquo; added Herr
Stauber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; suddenly said the soft, gentle
voice of the one who alone of all the circle favored
his plan. &ldquo;He must do what his genius bids
him do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surprised and greatly excited, Sebastian turned
to the speaker, his young cousin Maria Barbara,<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
and thankfully offered his hand. &ldquo;You understand
me,&rdquo; he said with emotion; &ldquo;now nothing more
can restrain me.&rdquo; With this closing word he left
the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Week after week passed. He had far exceeded
his one month&rsquo;s leave of absence and nothing had
been seen or heard of him. His friends were solicitous,
his superiors indignant, the congregation
angry. How could he so thoughtlessly violate his
duties? What could he be doing? Where could
he be? His conduct was simply incomprehensible
to everyone. Maria Barbara smilingly shook her
knowing little head when she heard the reproaches of
relatives and friends, the slurs of neighbors, and the
threats of the Superintendent, and said: &ldquo;You are
wasting your words. Sebastian would not care if
you should even say them to his face. He is living
and working for higher things than those which are
deemed of so much importance in Arnstadt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>And so it turned out. Two, three months
passed, and the indignation of the church-wardens
was at its height, when one fine day Sebastian suddenly
appeared at Johann Michael&rsquo;s and cheerfully
greeted his astonished relatives. He replied coolly
and unconcernedly to the storm of exclamations,
reproaches, and questions, tenderly greeted his
pretty little cousin, Maria Barbara, and at last,
when questions and complaints had ceased, said
briefly, &ldquo;I am accountable for all that I have done
or may do. My journey to L&uuml;beck was made
solely in the interests of the art which I practise for
the honor of God and for the edification of the
Christian congregation. All other considerations
must be subordinate to this higher purpose. Will
the Consistory and Council of Arnstadt complain
because in striving to rise higher and higher in my
art I have exceeded the time allowed me? Possibly
they may discharge me from my position. What
does that matter? Arnstadt is not the world. At
all times and in all places the world&rsquo;s door stands
open for the skilful artist. Offers have already
been made to me in L&uuml;beck. So do not be
troubled about me; I do what I must do and others
may do what they please&mdash;so enough of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; exultantly declared Maria
Barbara, looking round the circle. &ldquo;He cares
not a whit for your anxiety about him. He will
excel you all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you rogue,&rdquo; said Sebastian, smiling, &ldquo;I
did not know you were a prophet.&rdquo; The girl
blushed to the tips of her ears as he bent over her
and tenderly whispered, &ldquo;Can you also prophesy
the name of Sebastian&rsquo;s wife a year from to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; replied Maria Barbara, &ldquo;Frau
Bach. She certainly will have that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you cunning one! But the Christian name,
the Christian name&mdash;that is the question. Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot prophesy so much in one day,&rdquo; replied
the blushing girl; &ldquo;I will tell you that some other
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you to-day,&rdquo; whispered Sebastian.
&ldquo;She will be called Maria Barbara Bach. She is
a dear, fair-haired maiden, and the only person who
knows Sebastian through and through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be too sure,&rdquo; replied Maria Barbara, in
some confusion. &ldquo;Sometimes my prophecies do
not come true.&rdquo; The next instant she had slipped
away and disappeared in an adjacent room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year from now,&rdquo; the young artist said to
himself, with all the solemnity of a vow, as his eyes
followed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The apprehensions of his friends that measures
would be taken by his superiors to call him to account
were confirmed. He was summoned before
the Consistory and sharply reproved for his audacious
violation of his duties. His reply shows
clearly his real purpose: &ldquo;He had prolonged his
visit to L&uuml;beck solely in the interests of his art and
for his own improvement, so that he might come back
enriched with experience and many new ideas, which
would better fit him for his position; and likewise he
thought it would be better for his pupils. Beside
this, he had provided a substitute for the organ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brief explanation of his conduct did not satisfy
the old stiff-necked superiors, who did not at all
understand him. Beside this, the simple members
of the congregation, who did not appreciate his
efforts to elevate church music, complained that he
introduced strange variations in the chorales which
they could not follow. This called for further explanation;
rather than make which, Sebastian decided
to resign his Arnstadt position and look for another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Just at this time, Johann George Ahle, the highly
esteemed organist at St. Blasius&rsquo;s Church in the old
Thuringian imperial city of M&uuml;hlhausen, died, and
the position was offered to Sebastian. He was
ready at once, attended the organ examination, and
so highly impressed the wardens with his playing,
that they gave him the place. He expressed his
satisfaction with the salary, requested and obtained
his release from the Council at Arnstadt, and to his
great delight found that his place would be filled by
his cousin, Johann Ernst. To make the latter&rsquo;s position
easy at the outset, for he was very poor, and
beside had an old mother and sick sister to support,
Sebastian gave up a considerable part of his back
salary for Johann&rsquo;s benefit. Then he asked
for the hand of his loving cousin, received her
joyful consent as well as that of her family, and
on a wonderfully beautiful, quiet, sunny Autumn
morning went to Dornheim, where his faithful
friend, Johannes Laurentius Stauber, was settled
as minister. In the modest little village church,
before the altar hung with festive garlands, the
young pair exchanged rings and vows of love, and
then, after a quiet, happy day spent in the parsonage,
returned to Sebastian&rsquo;s own simple abode.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a>
A few weeks later the happy couple settled in
M&uuml;hlhausen and joyfully took possession of the
organist&rsquo;s old house. The simple furniture, which
they had jointly contributed, was soon cosily and
comfortably arranged, and when everything was in
its place and evening had come, the young bridegroom
seated himself at the little piano, and with a
heart overflowing with happiness sang and played
the beautiful chorale:</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/pp070.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="822" />
<p class="caption">The evening chorale in the new home</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I come, O Lord, before Thy throne</p>
<p class="t0">This happy evening tide,</p>
<p class="t0">And pray Thee, thro&rsquo; Thy precious Son,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou wilt with us abide.</p>
<p class="t0">Accept this offering of the heart</p>
<p class="t0">Which now I humbly bring,</p>
<p class="t0">And of Thy grace to us impart</p>
<p class="t0">While I Thy praises sing.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
</div>
<p>At the very first tones of the chorale, Maria Barbara
stepped behind his seat and with clear and
lovely alto voice joined in his sacred song. It was
the consecration of the day, a beautiful beginning of
the new life which God had prepared for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Musical Tournament</span></h2>
<p>Sebastian entered upon the duties of his
position at M&uuml;hlhausen with great enthusiasm,
and the friendly assurances of the
wardens as well as of the congregation
seemed to promise a long and successful tenure
of his position. This, however, could not be certain
if anything stood in the way of the elevation and
improvement of church music, which was the very
end and aim of his life. It was impossible for him
to adhere to the musty traditions and stereotyped
usages of musical craftsmen in small towns. It was
not only his purpose, but it was a necessity for him
to produce new creations, exhibiting a richer abundance
of ideas in enlarged form, and compositions
which would spiritually uplift his hearers and inspire
them with fresh religious exaltation. If this could
not be done in M&uuml;hlhausen&mdash;and he found only
too soon that it could not&mdash;then his stay there
must be short. His effort to reform church music
was at first obstructed, then openly opposed. The
families of the early organists and their friends, who
regarded the policy of the young man, &ldquo;the very
young man,&rdquo; as an insult to his predecessors, were
grieved. Malevolent townspeople criticised him,
and gossiped among themselves to this effect:
&ldquo;The organist is a freethinker and a subverter.
He has no respect for old and honored things. He
devises innovations, and plays a frivolous, ornamental
music instead of the plain, devout music
which simple people can understand. Herr Ahle
and his predecessors were a different kind of men.
Perhaps they did not know as much as Herr Bach,
but they were more pleasing organists in the sight
of God.&rdquo; It was a pitiable condition of things for
Sebastian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Sebastian resolved he would endure this misunderstanding
and malice no longer. With an impatient
shrug of his shoulders he announced to his
devoted young wife, &ldquo;We must take up the staff
anew, darling. We cannot grow in this atmosphere.
I cannot live where I cannot work for my highest
purpose; I must look around for another position.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do so, dearest,&rdquo; said Maria Barbara, smoothing
his wrinkled brow with loving hand. &ldquo;The world
is large, and a musician of your ability will be everywhere
welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In like manner his decision was approved by his
two gifted scholars in M&uuml;hlhausen, Johann Martin
Schubart and Johann Kaspar Vogler, and by his
real friends who had sympathized with his work
during his short stay, and this confirmed him in
making his decision final.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to Weimar in the morning,&rdquo; he said
with the utmost composure. &ldquo;The new Duke is a
warm friend of music and loves the higher church
style. Perhaps he will hear me and invite me to
enter his service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he hears you, he cannot help inviting you,&rdquo;
said Maria Barbara, confidently. &ldquo;God go with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went&mdash;and behold Maria Barbara once more
proved herself a true prophet. The musical circles
of Weimar were delighted not only with his splendid
playing upon the organ of the castle church, but also
with his fine piano-playing. The impression produced
by his performances was so convincing that
the Duke at once offered him the position of court
organist with a handsome salary, contingent upon
his securing release from his post at M&uuml;hlhausen.
Sebastian returned home delighted with his prospects,
and great was the joy of all when he told them
of the pleasant outcome of his Weimar visit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I can get my release from here, we will settle
down in Weimar this summer. What do you think
of that, dearest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we will,&rdquo; replied Maria Barbara,
most emphatically. &ldquo;The blind fools here, who do
not understand you, will let you go very willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will go with you,&rdquo; exclaimed his two
scholars, Schubart and Vogler. &ldquo;Need we stay
here without you, master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Sebastian, much pleased,
and Maria Barbara added, &ldquo;We will all stay together
until you become masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which will take a long time,&rdquo; muttered Vogler.</p>
<p>The M&uuml;hlhausen Council, as was expected, found
little difficulty in releasing the organist from his
duties, and the happy pair and his two faithful
scholars packed their little possessions in readiness
for settling down in the Ilm city.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is time for me to have rest and peace for a
few years,&rdquo; said Sebastian, as he sat down to his desk
after the change, &ldquo;for here I expect, if God so wills
it, to remain and take such firm root that at last I
may produce the perfect fruit. Hitherto I have
been only a little tree in a nursery, which the gardener
has set out among others, or stuck into the ground
for a week or so to save it, if possible, from dying.
Here there is good soil. I shall grow strong and
deep and do good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His expectations were gratified. Nine beautiful
and profitable years were spent in his favorite
Weimar&mdash;nine years of perfect domestic happiness,
and of satisfactory musical activity and production
and universally honorable recognition. It was
there Sebastian laid the firm foundation of his later
world-fame. It was there that he wrote those first
compositions which revealed him as the creator of a
new style, destined to elevate music from a time-serving,
mechanical craft to the position of an independent
art. It was there that a large family of
children blessed his home and eventually became
accomplished musicians under his faithful guidance
and instruction, his two scholars, Schubart and
Vogler, succeeding him in the same position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Some of the cantatas composed by him at
Weimar are of incomparable majesty and beauty;
for instance, the inspiring one in G minor, &ldquo;Aus der
Tiefe rufe ich, Herr, zu Dir&rdquo; (&ldquo;Out of the Depths
have I cried to Thee, O Lord&rdquo;); the wonderful
one in E flat major, &ldquo;Gottes Zeit is die allerbeste
Zeit&rdquo; (&ldquo;God&rsquo;s own Time is the best Time of all&rdquo;)&mdash;well
known under the name of &ldquo;Actus Tragicus&rdquo;;
and the heart-stirring one, &ldquo;Ich hatte viel Bekummerniss&rdquo;
(&ldquo;My Spirit was in Heaviness&rdquo;). These,
with the one beginning with the symphony in C
minor and closing with a wonderfully charming
chorus in C major, comprise a brilliant group.</p>
<p>These and similar compositions, the like of which
had not been known before, his unequalled organ
and piano playing, and his extraordinary facility in
developing variations or fugues from a given theme,
made him, though hardly thirty years of age, a
musical authority far and near. People came long
distances to hear him play on Sundays. Young
and old musicians studied the revelations of genius
in his compositions; and his Prince, proud of his
distinguished castle organist, appointed him ducal
concert and chapelmaster.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Bach&rsquo;s rising fame as a composer, as well as
pianist and organist, a few years later was the occasion
of a significant and extremely interesting event.
Among his celebrated foreign contemporaries was the
French musician, Jean Louis Marchand, who was
considered by his own countrymen an unrivalled
organ and piano player. In reality he was a vain,
pretentious person, and much more conceited about
himself than his uncritical and enthusiastic worshippers.
The foolish fellow indeed was so arrogant in
his manners that he offended the King of France,
whose court organist he was, and was banished.</p>
<p>The supercilious musician was in no wise humbled
by this bitter lesson, and his experiences during his
travels in Italy and Germany were not calculated to
make him less conceited. He was so successful in
dazzling the music-loving public with the brilliancy
of his compositions, as well as with the fascination
and elegance of his playing, that he was everywhere
hailed as a distinguished virtuoso and overwhelmed
with applause.</p>
<p>Marchand at last arrived in Dresden, and appeared
in a concert given at the Court of Friedrich
August I, where the French taste prevailed at that
time. The distinguished audience was so captivated
by him that its applause was almost unlimited, and
the King offered the arrogant Frenchman the position
of chapelmaster with a very handsome salary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>To prevent the consummation of the King&rsquo;s offer,
and at the same time to establish the superiority of
German over French art, Volumier, the director of
the royal orchestra at Dresden, who was well acquainted
with Sebastian&rsquo;s great skill and knowledge,
invited him to go to Dresden without delay, that
he might expose the pretensions of this Frenchman
and settle the superiority of German art, as well as
the superior honesty of German character.</p>
<p>Bach, fully aware of the corrupting influence of
French taste at that period, lost no time in accepting
the invitation, and went at once to Dresden. Volumier,
in the meantime, had commended him to the
King and Queen as a musician of equal rank with
Marchand, and he had barely arrived when a messenger
from Court brought him an invitation to a
royal concert, in which &ldquo;the highly renowned
French concert-master and unrivalled virtuoso, M.
Jean Louis Marchand, will appear,&rdquo; containing also
an intimation that the King would be glad to hear
him play. He cheerfully accepted, and as he entered
the hall in his plain black coat, accompanied
by Volumier, whose face was glowing with anticipation,
offered a striking contrast to the richly clad
and decorated Court attendants. All eyes were fixed
upon the simple Weimar organist, especially those
of the Frenchman, who, dressed in silk, velvet, and
point-lace, and blazing with gold and jewels, stared
contemptuously at his simple but deeply earnest
German rival.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>The concert at last began. Marchand with a
haughty smile, as if assured of victory, rose and
went to the piano. He played the melody of a
French song in a neat and spirited manner, varied
it with many little artifices and refinements, and
then, coming back to the melody, closed in spirited
and effective style. A storm of applause greeted
him as he rose. He looked around him with an
air of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very artistic work,&rdquo; said Sebastian, as the
courtiers and musicians crowded round Marchand,
&ldquo;and very elegantly and charmingly played.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied some of Marchand&rsquo;s
friends, with much satisfaction. &ldquo;Surely he is the
leading piano virtuoso of our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sebastian was silent, and appeared to be thinking
of the music he had just heard, when a page
brought him an invitation from the King to play
something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Your Majesty will deign to lend a gracious
ear to my humble playing,&rdquo; said Bach, modestly,
&ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo; He seated himself at the piano,
and after extemporizing a little in his own masterful
way, played Marchand&rsquo;s song through in most
graceful style, and then varied it twelve times, each
variation displaying originality and constantly increasing
skill and musical scholarship. His auditors,
even the connoisseurs, listened almost breathlessly.
At last he brought his performance to a close with
a bold and brilliant passage, rose from the instrument,
and after a gracious bow to the sovereign
went back quietly to his seat.</p>
<p>The silent astonishment of the assemblage now
gave way to a veritable jubilee of applause, and the
King, Queen, and Crown Prince were as enthusiastic
as the rest. The arrogant but now thoroughly
humiliated Frenchman, with rage and hatred in
his heart, retired among the crowd and quietly
disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>On the morning following the exciting event
Marchand received a very courteous letter from
Bach, in which, after complimenting him upon his
charming and elegant playing, he invited him to
select any theme he pleased for variation by the
former upon the piano in public, and expressed the
hope that Marchand would likewise take one
selected by him. The latter replied, accepting the
challenge to this musical tournament.</p>
<p>Great preparations were made for the event, under
the patronage of the Court. Friedrich August,
who anticipated an interesting evening, owing to the
rivalry of the two brilliant musicians, after receiving
Marchand&rsquo;s acceptance, selected the great salon
of his cabinet minister, Field Marshal Count von
Flemming, as the scene of the tournament. The
entire Court assembled at the appointed hour. All
the leading musicians of Dresden were there.
Volumier, cheerful in his confidence of victory, and
Bach, quiet and serious as was his wont, came in
after the audience was assembled. At nine o&rsquo;clock
the royal pair entered, preceded by Court officials
and accompanied by the Count and Countess
Flemming. There was one person absent&mdash;Jean
Louis Marchand!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>It was unheard-of rudeness to keep the King and
Queen waiting. The guests sat in painful suspense,
watching the door for the entrance of the Frenchman;
but they watched in vain. He did not
come. Count Flemming was in despair at the ruin
of the evening&rsquo;s pleasure. With the King&rsquo;s consent
a courier was despatched to Marchand&rsquo;s residence,
who returned with the disagreeable intelligence that
the Frenchman had left Dresden, post-haste, early
in the morning. The news fell like a bombshell in
their midst. The King was angry, the Court excited,
the German musicians quietly satisfied. Bach
alone appeared unmoved and uninterested in the
intelligence. It was a matter of course to him
that whenever a contest between French music and
German music was proposed, French music would
run away.</p>
<p>One of the King&rsquo;s pages again approached Bach
and said: &ldquo;His Majesty desires to speak with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sebastian quietly followed the boy. Standing
before the royal pair, he bowed low to the King and
lower still to the gentle Queen Ebahardine, and
modestly awaited their pleasure. The King scanned
the calm, earnest face of the young master, which
had not a trace of the embarrassment usually shown
by persons summoned before his Majesty, and with
flashing eyes and much excitement said, &ldquo;Your
rival, Monsieur Marchand, has not come to measure
his skill against yours. What do you think of his
conduct?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can only think there must have been very
strong reasons for his non-appearance before Your
Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not think that he is afraid to enter the
contest with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not be becoming for me to think so,&rdquo;
replied Bach, with some hesitation. &ldquo;Monsieur
Marchand is a very accomplished musician and excellent
player. I would not assume that he is unable
to improvise on a given theme. He may have
refused my challenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think and talk like an honorable man,&rdquo;
replied the King. &ldquo;But as Marchand, whatever
may be his reasons, is not here, may we not have
the pleasure of hearing the other contestant? Will
you not give us a specimen of your skill in variations
on some theme to be given you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to do so, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Friedrich August, addressing
the Queen, &ldquo;will Your Majesty give Bach a theme?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The noble Princess, not accustomed to have attention
shown her by her usually indifferent consort,
blushed slightly, but after a little reflection, said:
&ldquo;The year in which we live revives gracious
memories of our venerated Doctor Martin Luther
and his majestic hymn, &lsquo;Ein feste Burg ist unser
Gott&rsquo; (&lsquo;A Strong Castle is our God&rsquo;). Will you
take that chorale for your theme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart, Your Majesty,&rdquo; said Bach,
with much emotion. &ldquo;It is not very easy to follow
in the steps of that great man, but I will try with
God&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With deep feeling in his heart he went to the
piano. As he rested his fingers upon the keyboard,
they moved with the skill and inspiration of a
higher world, and the great Reformation hymn rang
through the <i>salon</i> with a fervor that uplifted and
inspired the souls of all. A devout silence rested
upon the assemblage. All eyes were fixed upon the
plain, simple man, whose eyes looked upward in a
spiritual ecstasy. All listened as if enchanted with
the wonderful tones which the gifted master evoked
from his instrument. Grander and more majestic
still was the effect when he built a fugue upon the
Luther hymn. It revealed the lowest depths of
the tone-world. The wonderful structure of word
and tone rose to the loftiest heights of religious
faith; and when at last his hands rested and the last
sound had died away, it seemed to the deeply-moved
hearers that they had come back from a purer sphere
into the atmosphere of this life, with ardent longings
for the one they had left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>The King, who was worldly minded and long a
stranger to religious faith, was nevertheless greatly
moved. The Queen, who was devout of soul, was
moved to tears. It was a moment in which all
present were lifted above the emptiness of court and
everyday life as they had never been before.</p>
<p>Rich with praise and fame, Bach returned to Weimar
from the Royal Court, with its exciting life, its
splendors and luxury, to the organist&rsquo;s little house,
full of simple happiness, soul-rest, and heart-peace;
and with him went the enduring recollection of the
tears of the pious Queen and the warm words of
gratitude she spoke to him, with pale cheeks and
with the deepest emotion, from trembling lips. It
was an event never to be forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Life and Work in Leipsic</span></h2>
<p>Sebastian&rsquo;s stay in Weimar ended in the
memorable year 1717. The congregation
considered him an eminent organist. As the
ducal chapelmaster he held a high social position.
His Prince let no opportunity pass to express
his appreciation of him. But his increasing family,
and the growing difficulty of supporting them, made
it imperative for him to secure a more remunerative
position, and Maria Barbara, though with some
regret, appreciated and accepted the situation.</p>
<p>While anxiously looking about him, Bach received
a cordial invitation from the music-loving Prince
Leopold of Anhalt-C&ouml;then to take the vacant position
of court organist and chapelmaster in the
capital city.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> The news was joyfully received at
home. As the salary was much larger than he had
been getting, Bach could not hesitate about accepting
the invitation, and so he resigned his position in
Weimar, though not without regret. He was consoled,
however, by the thought that as he was bettering
his circumstances his action would not be
misinterpreted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>It was a still greater consolation to know that his
place in Weimar would be filled by one who was
competent and thoroughly trained. His accomplished
scholar and friend, Johann Martin Schubart,
who had been a member of the family for ten years
and to whom he was closely attached, was to be his
successor. So Sebastian and Maria Barbara quietly
left the Ilm city, where they had lived so happily
for nine years and where his work had been so successful,
and went to their new home with bright
hopes for the future. These hopes were mostly
realized, and particularly in the improvement of their
outward circumstances. His income relieved him
from the serious anxieties which had troubled him
in Weimar, and thus left him free to work and create.
He also enjoyed the unusual appreciation of a music-loving
Prince, who not only manifested the highest
interest in his work, but bestowed upon him his
personal friendship, an advantage of no small value
in those days. He was no longer the son of the
poor cantor of Eisenach, brought up as a duty by
his relatives; no longer the orphan who was censured
and lectured by church fathers for his innovations,
but a man in the very flower of life, in the
full enjoyment of his musical freedom and allowed
to work out his ideas in his own way, and a greatly
honored composer, whose acquaintance was eagerly
sought by prominent people and whose friendship
a noble Prince was proud to enjoy. How far he had
exceeded the conventional limits of his position is
shown by the fact that, when a son was born to him
in 1718, the Prince, his brother, August Ludwig of
Anhalt, Eleonora Wilhelmina, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar,
Privy Councillor Von Zanthier, and the
Baroness Von Nostiz, stood as sponsors at the
christening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Aided by these favoring circumstances, and particularly
by the active sympathy of Prince Leopold,
Sebastian, incited by his strong passion for creating,
entered upon a new path&mdash;that of instrumental
composition. It was there that he brought to its
highest development that use of the polyphonic
style on the organ which was peculiarly his own.
In rapid succession he produced those great works
for piano, and in chamber and orchestral music,
which have been admired from that time to this,
viz., the six so-called &ldquo;Brandenburg Concertos,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a>
several suites,<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> a large number of sonatas<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a>
and duets, not a few compositions for piano alone, his two-part
inventions,<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> and three-part symphonies,<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> and, greater
than all these, the first part of that masterly and
unrivalled work which is known as the &ldquo;Well
Tempered Clavichord&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a>&mdash;a creation of art which
required twenty years for completion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Before this great work was completed, a cruel fate
overtook the master&mdash;a blow which the loving pair
little expected when they began the new life with
such bright hopes. During a journey which Sebastian
made with the Prince, who was accustomed to take
the waters at Carlsbad, his wife was stricken with a
sudden and fatal illness, and to the unspeakable
grief of the children died in a few days. The mail-service
in those days was so wretched and uncertain
that letters, especially those sent to foreign countries,
were frequently long delayed, so that Sebastian received
no tidings of his affliction. Little dreaming
of the terrible loss he had sustained, he spent some
time with the Prince at Carlsbad, but at last, unable
longer to resist his longing for home, he returned,
only to make the dreadful discovery that the wife
whom he had left so well and happy was in her
grave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Only a strong, devout nature, like that of Bach&rsquo;s,
and the consolations of sacred music could have
enabled the bereaved husband to endure such an
affliction. The sorrowing Sebastian nevertheless
passed sad days, weeks, and months, and even the
warm sympathy of the Prince had but little consolation
for him. Fortunately, two important duties
fully occupied his time&mdash;the education of his children
and the musical instruction of his three gifted sons,
Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl Philipp Emanuel, and
Johann Gottfried Bernhard, which kept him absorbed
in his art. A journey which he made about
this time to Hamburg was also of great help to him.
He went there to see, and, if possible, to hear,
Johann Adam Reinken, the greatest master of the
perfect organ style and of counterpoint, and bring
back still higher standards for his own work. He
was welcomed by the musical circles of Hamburg
as a famous and honored master; but the old
Reinken, being frail and weak, was inaccessible, and
Bach soon began to grow uneasy at the possibility
that he might have to return without gratifying his
desire, when suddenly and unexpectedly a happy
chance relieved his suspense.</p>
<p>On one of the last days of his stay in Hamburg,
Bach played before a large and very distinguished
audience upon the fine organ in St. Katharine&rsquo;s
Church. When the applause had ceased and he
was about to leave the organ, an earnest and unanimous
request was sent to him to improvise upon a
chorale, and he consented. He selected the chorale
&ldquo;By the Rivers of Babylon,&rdquo; which Reinken, at the
very outset of his career, had arranged in a similar
manner, and improvised with marvellous skill in
long and artistic variations upon the noble theme.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/pp092.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="811" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>I thought this art was dead; now that I see it lives I shall depart in peace.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Reinken</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>His listeners were deeply moved by the breadth
and power of his playing, but the player himself
was still more deeply moved when the venerable
Reinken, then in his ninety-ninth year, rose with
effort from his seat in the front row, came forward
and embraced him, saying with deep emotion: &ldquo;I
thought this art had died out; now that I see it still
lives, I shall pass away in peace.&rdquo; Bach was greatly
affected by the occurrence and the master&rsquo;s parting
words. No worldly recognition, not even that of
the King, could have made him so happy. Tears
came to his eyes, and he returned the old man&rsquo;s
embrace with ardor and as if reluctant to let him
go. Bach left Hamburg with a feeling of exaltation
he had never experienced before. It seemed
to him he was wearing an invisible crown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The beautiful and powerful organs of Hamburg,
as well as the many music-loving and musically intelligent
circles of Handel&rsquo;s city, which had welcomed
him and recognized his ability, were precious
memories to Sebastian long after his return. How
insignificant little C&ouml;then appeared in comparison!
How lonely he was there with no opportunities to
utilize his great skill and knowledge! Had it not
been for the Prince, who fully appreciated his high
purpose and loved and understood music so well,
and for the friendship he had bestowed upon him,
Bach&rsquo;s craving for a higher sphere of activity, and his
longing for better musical advantages and a more intelligent
and appreciative musical public, would have
induced him to look about for another field of labor.
But there came a time, at last, when the sole consideration
that kept him in C&ouml;then was removed in a
singular manner, and he could justify his leaving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>The Prince, who had long been on most cordial
terms with the court of Anhalt-Bernburg, was
betrothed to a princess there, and became so absorbed
in his approaching nuptials that his interest
in music began to wane and his friendship for Bach
became perceptibly weaker. Sebastian was greatly
troubled about it, but he decided it was only fair to
make some allowances for the Prince, and tried to
believe that the old love (for music) would at last
assert itself and take its place next the new love,
and that the old friendly relations would be completely
restored. In this hope he waited, but he
was doomed to disappointment. There was a complete
change in his princely patron and friend. His
interest in music lessened more and more, and when
at last the young Princess came, it was apparent that
she had no real love of music. As Bach expressed
it, she was simply bent upon being entertained, and
henceforth music at Court would only be an amusement.
This rendered Bach&rsquo;s position not only
unprofitable, but absolutely useless, and thus the
last tie that bound him to C&ouml;then was severed.
He was now as eager to get away as formerly he
had been eager to get there.</p>
<p>As if for the very purpose of providing him a
place where he could find full scope for his ability,
Kuhnau, the esteemed musical director of the St.
Thomas School in Leipsic, died,<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> and Bach decided
to apply for the position. The matter of filling the
vacancy was deferred to the next year; but in the
Summer of 1723 an invitation was sent to him and
to two other fellow-workers in music to go to
Leipsic and show proof of their skill. The decision
of the judges was in Bach&rsquo;s favor after they
heard his performance of his beautiful cantata,
&ldquo;Jesus called the Twelve unto Him.&rdquo; He entered
upon his duties at once, and in this position he rose
to the summit of his art. Death alone released him,
a quarter of a century later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The directorship of St. Thomas&rsquo;s was not unworthy
of Bach. The traditions of the school were
dignified, and its standing was high. He was at
the same time musical director of the St. Nicholas
and St. Thomas churches, likewise of St. Peter&rsquo;s
and the &ldquo;New Church.&rdquo; He was also leader
of the &ldquo;Alumneum,&rdquo; consisting of fifty or sixty
&ldquo;Alumni,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> who were obliged to assist in the
church musical services. This school, which grew
out of the convent of St. Thomas, had had many
excellent teachers and had attained a high standard
of excellence. Both patrons and teachers
had striven earnestly to maintain this standard and
also to keep the musical department up to the high
rank of the classical. Bach therefore undertook
the task of maintaining old and time-honored traditions
and standards. He ranked third among his
colleagues, after the Rector, a head-master, and the
co-rector, or assistant-master, and alternated with
them in school inspection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>This comprehensive scheme of duties, and his
general surroundings in Leipsic, had a powerful influence
upon the great musician. Famous as the
city of Handel, and as a centre of life and movement,
it was also a centre of great intellectual
activity, and boasted among its educators men of
European fame. Beside this, Leipsic enjoyed unusual
freedom in the control of its municipal affairs,
which gave the city a lively, flourishing aspect,
all of which could not fail to make a deep and
favorable impression upon a man of Bach&rsquo;s active,
resolute disposition. In this vigorous atmosphere
he revelled in the spirit of republican independence,
and his passion for musical creation grew stronger,
and remained strong to the end.</p>
<p>He was also delighted that at last he was able to
carry out his plans with regard to organ work.
He had at his disposal the so-called &ldquo;greater
organ&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> of St. Thomas&rsquo;s Church, which had been
there for two centuries and had been thoroughly
repaired three years before this time. Bach was
transported with delight as he awoke and set in
motion the slumbering tone-forces of this magnificent
instrument. It seemed to him there was nothing
more to wish for in life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The sorrow occasioned by the death of his faithful
wife at last gave place to domestic happiness. For
the sake of his children, who needed a mother&rsquo;s
care, he married again, and in Anna Magdalena
W&uuml;lkens,<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> daughter of a court musician to the
Duke of Weissenfeld, he found a beautiful compensation
for his loss. She transformed the sad house
into a happy home. She brought up her stepchildren
faithfully and carefully. She appreciated
the great musical schemes of her husband, assisted
him in his work, not only with all her heart&rsquo;s affection,
but with much musical ability, took lessons
from him, copied his manuscripts accurately, and
sang in the choir,&mdash;for she possessed, greatly to
Bach&rsquo;s delight, a fresh, young, beautiful soprano
voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>In the meantime the older children by the first
marriage grew up strong and full of promise. The
first-born son, Wilhelm Friedemann, was wonderfully
precocious in his early youth. His father
naturally was very fond of him, and had taught
him with the utmost care. He was ambitious to
leave to posterity a worthy successor, qualified to
continue his own life-work, perhaps to surpass him.
He had reason to believe this. Even in boyhood
Friedemann had virtually mastered the piano and
organ, performed the most difficult exercises in
counterpoint with as much ease as if they were
mere play, and &ldquo;lived and moved&rdquo; in music.</p>
<p>In general education, also, Friedemann was not
behind any of his associates. In St. Thomas&rsquo;s
School, which was very progressive, he advanced
rapidly from one class to another, and also became
an accomplished violin virtuoso under the instructions
of concertmaster Graun, afterward chamber
musician to Frederick the Great. He left the
school at an early age, and studied at the University
with the most famous teachers enthusiastically
and successfully. From there he came home and
entered the competition for the organist&rsquo;s position
at St. Sophia&rsquo;s Church in Dresden. He was
looked upon there as the favorite son and scholar
of his great father. The dignity, grandeur, and
power of his playing excited the astonishment even
of the musical critics who heard him. His command
of the instrument was so absolute, and his
improvising so rich, new, and varied in style, that
his hearers could hardly believe their ears, and
many of them had trouble in following the flight of
his genius.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>After the trial, the judges unanimously agreed
that Friedemann was by far the best and most skilful
among the candidates, and so the youth of twenty-three
was officially assigned the important place at
Saint Sophia&rsquo;s Church. What joy and satisfaction
filled his father&rsquo;s loving heart! It was one of the
happiest days of his life! Alas! he little thought
that a demon was menacing the genius of the youth,
a demon that would attack it incessantly, and ultimately
destroy it.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>Next to Friedemann, and equal with him in his
educational acquirements, was the highly gifted second
son, Carl Philipp Emanuel. He was ten years
of age when the Bach family left for Leipsic, but
even then manifested such unusual musical promise
that his father&rsquo;s fondest expectations were encouraged,
and in this case they were fulfilled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>It is time to return to Bach, the father. It has
already been said that his life and work were greatly
influenced by his new residence and the change in
his circumstances. It was in Leipsic he displayed
those extraordinary achievements which were little
understood by his contemporaries, but which have
been admired for their beauty and regarded with astonishment
for their scholarship by posterity. These
great achievements were also accompanied by extraordinary
wealth of production. Bach&rsquo;s creative
energy at this time was like a rushing stream. No
musician before or since has accomplished such
results in composition as Bach during the Leipsic
period. Music of every kind poured forth rapidly
and in rich abundance. Oratorios and Passion
music, cantatas and motets, masses and concertos,
piano and other instrumental works, and, greatest of
all, that priceless treasure of profoundly conceived
and perfectly constructed preludes and fugues, which
the German people claim, and always will claim, as
their own most beautiful and intellectual musical
possession, are the outcome of the comparatively
brief Leipsic period. How rich, deep, and varied
were the creations of his intellect! How resistlessly
he struggled on in spite of musical trademasters!
How thoroughly he studied the works of the great
masters of the past and of his time! He copied with
his own hand a mass of music which was of use to
him in his work, finished his masterpiece &ldquo;The
Well-Tempered Clavichord,&rdquo; instructed half a hundred
Alumni, beside numerous private scholars and
his own children, kept up a constantly growing
correspondence, and read with absorbing interest
everything in print at that time which had important
bearings upon his work. Posterity can only
wonder how the great master, in addition to all this,
found time to look after his private affairs and those
of his large household.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;He shall stand before Kings&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Beside the burdens of his official position
and the fatigue of his extraordinary musical
activity, Bach realized the infirmities of
old age at a comparatively early period.
He had overtaxed his strength in his youth, and
this now began to affect his physical powers. He
was also threatened with the loss of sight&mdash;a possibility
which greatly alarmed his family.</p>
<p>On account of this danger, he exerted himself as
rapidly as was judicious in preparing his children for
their future work and fitting them to act for themselves.
As has already been said, Friedemann, his
most gifted and best-beloved son, had been organist
at Dresden since 1733. Bach had often visited him,
and sought by paternal counsel and affectionate warning
to dissuade him from the eccentricities and extravagances
to which he was prone, and to keep him
in the right path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The second son, Carl Philipp Emanuel, was very
successful in the University, which he left in 1738,
and proved himself not only such a gifted musician
but excellent scholar in the sciences, that the Crown
Prince of Prussia, known in history as Frederick
the Great, summoned him from Rheinsberg to
take the place of pianist in his musical chapel.
There we shall shortly see him.</p>
<p>The third son, Johann Gottfried Bernhard, born
at Weimar in 1715, was such a skilful player and
accomplished contrapuntist at the age of twenty
that he was fitted to fill an organist&rsquo;s position with
credit. A position of this kind was offered him
about this time, partly at the solicitation of his
famous father. M&uuml;hlhausen, the city in which
Bach himself, a quarter of a century before, had
spent the golden days of his first youthful freedom
and domestic happiness, in grateful remembrance
of the famous father gave the not-yet-famous son
the organist&rsquo;s position, much to the former&rsquo;s delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Not long after this, another occurrence gave
Bach great satisfaction. The Elector of Saxony and
King of Poland, Frederick Augustus III, who was
so greatly interested in the musical tournament at
Count Flemming&rsquo;s palace, when Marchand, the
Frenchman, evaded Bach&rsquo;s challenge by flight, had
not lost sight of the master. After hearing him
play at a church concert in Dresden, he appointed
him &ldquo;composer to His Majesty the King of
Poland and Elector of Saxony&rdquo;&mdash;a distinction
which at that time was much sought after because
of its personal value and far-reaching influence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The old saying, &ldquo;A prophet is not without honor
save in his own country,&rdquo; was verified in Bach&rsquo;s
case. He was greatly annoyed and distressed by
serious differences and often very disagreeable disputes
with his superiors, and sometimes with the
Rector, over the affairs of the Thomas School and
Church. Those small souls could not understand,
much less appreciate, the unequalled achievements
of a musician like Bach. From their point of view
he was simply the Cantor of St. Thomas&rsquo;s, and
they grumbled and found fault whenever his actions
or regulations were not in accordance with their
commonplace ideas. The continual vexation which
this caused him, as well as the feeling that such
conduct on the Rector&rsquo;s part must eventually bring
both himself and his work into disgrace, led him
seriously to contemplate resigning his position in
Leipsic and seeking a new home elsewhere. With
this contingency in view, he turned his eyes to
Dantsic, a music-loving city, and with all the more
hopefulness because Erdmann, the old true friend
of his boyhood, lived and held an important position
there. Since their separation at L&uuml;neburg, Bach
had kept up an irregular but cordial correspondence
with his friend, and had the satisfaction of
knowing that he held him in affectionate remembrance,
and sympathized warmly with him in his
welfare as well as in his troubles. Bach stated his
circumstances to him with the utmost frankness, and
complained of his meagre salary and the restrictions
placed upon him by his unappreciative superiors,
which exposed him to continual annoyance, jealousy,
and persecution. Erdmann, who held an imperial
position at that time, was extremely cordial, and promised
to use his powerful influence in carrying out his
friend&rsquo;s wishes, though he could not do anything right
away in securing a situation for him. This was not
necessary, for relief soon came from another source.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>That same year the rectorate was vacant, and,
greatly to Bach&rsquo;s delight, the learned Professor
Gesner,<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> who knew the value of his work, succeeded
to the position. The change in his circumstances
made the life of the greatly troubled and poorly
paid Cantor much more endurable, both in Leipsic
and in the school. To the close of his life he found
consolation for all earthly trouble and insufficiency
in those inexhaustible sources of lofty musical ideas
which God had given him to develop to the highest
point of which he was capable, and to hand down to
posterity in unsurpassed form. His happy domestic
life, the success of his children, and the fine progress
of his scholars, who gradually became skilful musicians,
also strengthened and encouraged him; while
his intimate relations with the Thuringian members
of the family, who often visited him, and admired
and loved him, helped keep his heart young.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Thus the years passed,&mdash;years of continuous care
and toil, of faithful work &ldquo;for the honor of the
Highest,&rdquo; of many severe personal trials, but also
of many kindnesses, which strengthened the heart
of the master as he grew aged. His fame grew
beyond Leipsic. The number of his majestic
tone-creations greatly increased. He was without
a rival as a profoundly learned composer and skilful
organist and pianist. And yet with all his honor
and fame he worked quietly, unpretentiously, and
manfully in his little closet at home for the support
of his large family, and with absolute sincerity
devoted his work to the glory of the Highest.</p>
<p>The saddest burden of his last years was the
growing misconduct of his favorite son, Wilhelm
Friedemann. Even in his boyhood he had manifested
abnormal tendencies toward eccentricity, and
in the course of years it had made him more and
more disliked. Beside this, still worse traits of
character revealed themselves, such as imperious
haughtiness and repulsing moroseness of disposition,
persistent indulgence in extravagant and bizarre musical
fancies, notwithstanding the warnings of his
father and friends, and, finally, over-indulgence in
drink. Owing to his insolence, he had to leave his
position in Dresden. With much difficulty he secured
the place of organist at St. Mary&rsquo;s Church,
in Halle; but even there, desirable as the position
was, he made no effort to curb his extravagances
and dissolute habits, so that his father had good
grounds for solicitude as to his future. And yet he
charmed everyone with his fanciful and brilliant
playing, and the hope was generally expressed that
his talent would ultimately reach as high a standard
of development as that of his father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>The progress of the second son, however, rejoiced
the heart of the much-enduring old master. After
the Crown Prince Frederick succeeded to the throne
made vacant by the death of his father, Philipp
Emanuel was appointed royal chamber musician
and court pianist at Potsdam and Berlin, and was
at this time enjoying the personal and musical distinction
he so well deserved. Everything that came
from him&mdash;letters, compositions, musical tidings
of every kind&mdash;brought joy to the old father at St.
Thomas&rsquo;s, and caused him to rejoice in the rising fame
and good fortune of his manly son. A message
which Emanuel sent at this time to his father made
ample compensation for all the trials of the last few
years, and filled the modest home at St. Thomas&rsquo;s
with unalloyed satisfaction and delight. Frederick II,
King of Prussia, the admired of all the world, victor
at Hohenfriedberg and Sohr,<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> expressed his sincere
admiration of &ldquo;Master Bach&rdquo; and the wish to see
him in Potsdam as soon as convenient.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Bach was deeply moved by the message. All
thoughts of his troubles in Leipsic disappeared,
all his anxieties and cares were forgotten, and with
fresh strength and courage he faced the future.
There was nothing higher, nothing more precious
in his estimation than his personal recognition by
the greatest prince of his time. The future had
nothing in store for him that could shake his courage
or lessen his creative energy.</p>
<p>And yet the modest musician delayed gratifying
the wish of the King. It was only when Frederick
repeated his request in a more emphatic manner and
threatened, in pleasant banter, to send a squad of
hussars to Leipsic and arrest him and fetch him
across the boundaries, that the old Cantor started for
Berlin. With him went Wilhelm Friedemann,
&ldquo;Son of sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tedious day&rsquo;s journey was coming to its close,
and the Sunday vesper bells were ringing in the
Potsdam turrets, when (May 4, 1747) our eagerly
expectant travellers came to the gate, and announced
their names and occupations to the gatekeeper, as
was the custom. With anxious hearts they entered
the city, and went to the quarter where Philipp
Emanuel resided as court musician. Bach was received
by his daughter-in-law most cordially, as was
also Friedemann with sisterly kindness, and he embraced
the grandchildren whom she brought to him
at once, with much emotion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;How delighted Emanuel will be,&rdquo; said the pretty
little woman over and over, and then added significantly,
&ldquo;and also his Majesty, our all-gracious
King. Scarcely a day has passed for a month, in
which his Majesty has not asked at the evening
concert, &lsquo;Is your father here yet?&rsquo; or, &lsquo;When is
your father coming?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Majesty is very kind,&rdquo; replied Bach, with
evident pleasure. &ldquo;We must announce our arrival
without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gatekeeper has done that already in his
report, but it will also be well to send word to
Emanuel before the evening concert begins. He
has already been at the castle an hour, tuning a fine
Silbermann piano.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Thereupon the brisk little woman went out and
sent a boy-pupil with the message, bidding him go
to the castle as fast as he could. The two travellers
in the meantime refreshed themselves, after the
fatigue of their journey, with a hearty meal, and were
chatting cosily with Frau Gertrude, when the housemaid
appeared at the door and announced a court
messenger, who wished to speak at once with Herr
Music Director Bach, of Leipsic. He was bidden
to enter, and Bach greeted him with a pleasant smile,
as if aware of the nature of his message. The messenger
made a courtly bow, and said: &ldquo;His Majesty
has heard of the arrival of Herr Bach, and graciously
orders him to appear without delay at his castle. I
am ordered to accompany him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will put on a more fitting dress,&rdquo; replied
Bach, somewhat excited, &ldquo;so that I may make as
suitable an appearance as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messenger, however, promptly informed him
that would be against his Majesty&rsquo;s express command.
&ldquo;I am ordered to fetch you to the castle
without any delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bach, smiling, as he somewhat ruefully
surveyed his homely but well-fitting brown
coat, &ldquo;the command of his Majesty must be
obeyed. Let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>In the meantime there was a scene of exciting
interest at the castle. At the hour appointed for
the concert, the entire royal chapel was assembled
in the music hall. It promised to be a notable
evening, for the King was to play first flute in a
concerto. The members of the chapel, among them
Graun, Quantz, Agricola,<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> and Emanuel Bach,
were engaged in earnest conversation about the
piece, when a quick step was heard and the King
entered.</p>
<p>The young sovereign carried a roll of music
under his arm, and in his hand his favorite flute in
its velvet case. With a genial smile and a hearty
&ldquo;Good-evening, gentlemen,&rdquo; he went to the piano,
laid down his flute-case and began to arrange the
music upon the desks, smiling at his players and
saying in a bantering manner: &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,
we are going to try something of importance this
evening. It is Quantz&rsquo;s latest work, and,&rdquo; turning
to Quantz, &ldquo;he has not made it very easy for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Quantz, with great
respect, &ldquo;music is not mere play for unpractised
fingers and heads, but hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; replied the King; &ldquo;I found that out
while studying my part. I shall be surprised if we
succeed in satisfying you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as Your Majesty is concerned, I am
satisfied in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! there! you are a flatterer. We shall
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King took his case from the piano and began
putting his flute together. He was just about to
try it, when the door opened and an official appeared,
standing on the threshold and fixing his
gaze upon the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Your Majesty please, the gate-list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, so; let me have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the King, still with his flute in his hand,
glanced over the paper, he suddenly gave a start,
looked again, and turning to his band, said, &ldquo;Gentlemen,
great news! The elder Bach has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His announcement caused much excitement.
Emanuel alone retained his composure.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s large blue eyes glistened, and smiles
illumined his face. &ldquo;Yes, yes, Herr Pianist, your
eminent father has arrived, and undoubtedly this
moment is at your residence. He must come here
at once. I have waited to no purpose long enough.
He must come at once&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/pp114.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="823" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>Gentlemen! Good news! The old Bach has come.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Frederick the Great</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Your Majesty&rsquo;s wish that I fetch my
father?&rdquo; said Emanuel, ready to start at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, hurry!&mdash;or, no; stay here. There
will be no end of questions and talk when you
meet, and that means delay. I had better send
another, who will bring him without any ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King rang a bell on the pier-table and a
lackey appeared at the door. &ldquo;Let a messenger be
sent without an instant&rsquo;s delay to the residence of
the court pianist, with instructions to fetch the
organist, Herr Bach, who has just arrived from
Leipsic, to the castle at once. Do you understand?
The messenger must take no excuse of any kind
for delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Your Majesty pleases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man disappeared, and the King turned to his
band with a beaming smile. &ldquo;We have the old
man at last. Gather up your music, gentlemen; we
will play your concerto, Quantz, some other time.
This evening we shall listen to one greater than any
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The musicians obeyed, and then stood whispering
together. All this time the King was pacing up and
down the hall impatiently, with his flute still under
his arm. At last he stopped. &ldquo;Graun, a word
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Graun approached the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Graun. We must let old Bach hear
some good music of our own time. What have we
to offer him from the opera repertory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Your Majesty please, we have Hasse&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Artaxerxes,&rsquo; Porpora&rsquo;s &lsquo;Annibale&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mitridate,&rsquo;
Handel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faramondo&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! We must have something of our
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps one of Agricola&rsquo;s pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, still better, why not one of Graun&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said
the King, laughing.</p>
<p>Graun bowed. &ldquo;In that case, and in obedience
to Your Majesty, I make bold to suggest the
&lsquo;Galatea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! because I myself stumbled around a little
in that pastoral music?<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> Ah! ah! Graun, have
you also begun to be a courtier? What will become
of my band? No, no, we will not have
&lsquo;Galatea.&rsquo; We will have &lsquo;Demofoonte&rsquo; or &lsquo;Caius
Fabricius.&rsquo; What do you think of those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have well practised both, Your Majesty, but
&lsquo;Cinna&rsquo; is completely ready. If Your Majesty is so
disposed, we can give Herr Bach the first act of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good, we can manage it; but we will talk
about it later. As to the rest, I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the door opened and the lackey
announced, &ldquo;Herr Bach, of Leipsic, is in the anteroom
and at Your Majesty&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him enter, let him enter,&rdquo; exclaimed the
King, as he laid aside his flute, and his face lit up
with smiles. &ldquo;Dear Bach, bring in your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emanuel hastened to the anteroom, and a few
seconds later father and son entered the hall together.
With the most gracious friendliness and cordiality
Frederick met the old master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have you at last, my dear Bach,&rdquo; he said,
affectionately offering both hands to him as he stood
bowing low, &ldquo;and now I propose to hold you fast.
I have had hard work to get a sight at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old, careworn master was deeply affected by
his reception, and so agitated as he kissed the hand
of the victorious sovereign that for a few minutes he
was speechless. As soon as he could master his
feelings, he expressed his profound gratitude for so
much graciousness and kindness, explaining at the
same time how difficult it was to get an extended
leave of absence from his superiors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will see about that,&rdquo; replied the King,
with a suggestive smile. &ldquo;The deuce take those
Leipsic fossils! They have made me also wait long
and to no purpose for you. I will attend to this,
and when I go to Leipsic again with my grenadiers&mdash;which
I may do any time, as long as they keep
that intriguing nuisance, Br&uuml;hl,<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> in office&mdash;I will
punish them in a way that will put an end to their
nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The King then led the old master into the room
and introduced him to the musicians at their desks,
as well as to the gentlemen-in-waiting. He had a
pleasant word for each, and showed so little embarrassment
in his new surroundings that Philipp
Emanuel was greatly surprised. The gentlemen
of the Court also were favorably impressed by the
old musician, who attracted them all by his simple
dignity and ease of manner.</p>
<p>The King looked affectionately at him. &ldquo;Dear
Bach,&rdquo; he said with genuine tenderness, &ldquo;I am
doubly glad you arrived to-day. Only an hour
ago two Silbermann pianos, for which I have long
waited, were delivered at the castle, and I would like
to have your expert opinion of them. I am aware
that you are not an unconditional advocate of the
Silbermann technic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not at the beginning,&rdquo; said Bach, modestly.
&ldquo;It would not have been right so long as its
mechanism had serious faults; but in the course of
years it has been improved by skilful and intelligent
men, its faults have been corrected, and now it
really is a masterpiece. Your Majesty has made
no mistake in getting them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, I hope not,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;but
now let us look at them. One is in my workroom
and the other is in my chamber. Ho, there! Lights!
The gentlemen of the chapel are welcome to join us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Headed by the King and Bach, they went from
one room to another, and Bach tried seven of these
pianos, extemporizing so delightfully that the King
was lost in admiration. &ldquo;Splendid! splendid! that
was masterly, dear Bach!&rdquo; he exclaimed several
times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty is too generous,&rdquo; said the old
Cantor. &ldquo;It does not require much musical ability
to show off a piano. I pray you for some more
important task than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, if you call that of no importance
we must try something else. Will you take a theme
and construct a fugue and variations upon it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly, Your Majesty, and if you are willing I
will use the piano in Your Majesty&rsquo;s workroom.
It is the best of all the instruments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too. Come in, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All entered the apartment, eager with expectation,
and grouped themselves around the piano.
&ldquo;Now, select a theme, dear Bach, and give us a
three-part fugue, if it be not asking too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old master smiled quietly. &ldquo;Will not Your
Majesty have the goodness to give me the theme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? I? And you will extemporize a fugue
and variations at the same time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it so please Your Majesty, I will undertake
it with God&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say&mdash;but you shall have your
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King went to the piano, stood a moment in
thought, and then gracefully and elegantly played
this charming theme:</p>
<div class="img">
<p class="center"><i>Theme</i></p>
<a href="images/1000.mid"><img src="images/1000.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="185" /></a>
<br /><a class="ab1 small center" href="images/1000.mid">play</a></div>
<p>&ldquo;Does that satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bach bowed respectfully, seated himself at the
instrument, and began extemporizing a prelude of
the same character as the theme, and as only he
could do it. For some time he developed it beautifully,
and then with graceful facility worked up the
theme itself, in three parts, with such depth of feeling,
richness of conception and harmonic color, and above
all with such an absolute mastery of technic, that the
musicians held their breath, and the King, standing
behind Bach, was transfixed with astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Marvellous!&rdquo; he whispered more than once, and
when Bach closed with a contrapuntal masterpiece,
the so-called stretto,<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> he exclaimed enthusiastically:
&ldquo;Truly, there is but one Bach!&rdquo; and embraced the
deeply moved master with the affectionate familiarity
of a fellow-artist. After this, he said he would retire
to enjoy the impression made upon him, but would
see Bach again the next day, as he wished to show
him the organs in the Potsdam churches and hear
him play on them. Bach cheerfully consented, and
after making his adieus passed a quiet evening in
his own family circle.</p>
<p>The next day, at the appointed hour, the royal
carriage stopped at Emanuel&rsquo;s door, and at the
King&rsquo;s request Friedemann accompanied his father.
They were soon at the Church of the Holy Spirit,
where the organ was in readiness and the King was
awaited. In the meantime the church rapidly filled
up with persons of high social standing and Court
attendants, and soon the King&rsquo;s carriage was heard at
the door. With a quick step the sovereign entered,
hastily greeting those in attendance, and making
his way to the organ-loft, where he warmly greeted
the master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Bach, yesterday you served me a magnificent
musical feast, which I greatly enjoyed; but you
know the old saying: &lsquo;The appetite grows by what
it feeds upon,&rsquo; and I am free to say that to-day I
am longing to hear a performance such as only you
can give us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what might that be, Your Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fugue in six parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but our theme of yesterday, as Your
Majesty well knows, is not adapted to that style
of polyphonic treatment. If Your Majesty will
graciously choose one that is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Bach, choose a fitting one yourself; we
shall be the gainers thereby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty has only to command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King nodded his assent, took a seat a little
apart from his retinue, and Bach began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>A majestic prelude rang from the organ in a
mighty flood of tone, ever bolder and more triumphant,
until, reaching a climax, it gave place to
the majestic chorale, &ldquo;Ich weiss dass mein Erl&ouml;ser
lebt&rdquo; (&ldquo;I know that my Redeemer liveth&rdquo;), which
he developed in six parts with a dignity of style and
a divine fervor that entranced his hearers. The
characteristics of the theme and the accompanying
modulations, the freedom and brilliancy of his
treatment, the clearness of the composition, and the
individuality of the single parts, all combined to
make a marvellous performance. The King was
so enthusiastic that he embraced the old master, and
exclaimed with emotion: &ldquo;I have heard the utmost
of which the divine art is capable! I am glad I
have lived to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an inspiring day for the great musician.
His son, Friedemann, also had to play for the King
when they came to another church, and was heartily
appreciated by the musicians, who could not resist
the charm of his talent and performance. Other
days not less inspiring followed these. It was a
time so full of spiritual comfort and contentment
that Bach devoted himself to composition, and produced
one great work after another as if he had
renewed his youthful power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The King paid him affectionate attention to the
last day of his visit in Potsdam, showed him everything
worth seeing and remembering in Berlin, and
magnanimously tendered him the highest honors
in the royal musical service, which, though with
some heaviness of heart, Bach declined out of consideration
for his son Emanuel, asking for himself
only the continuation of the royal favor and
kindness. With sincere emotion the noble sovereign
promised this. Bach left Potsdam after many
happy weeks, and returned to his disagreeable Leipsic
post, with a melancholy presentiment that the King&rsquo;s
promise to have another visit sometime would not
be fulfilled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Last of Earth</span></h2>
<p>It was only natural for the old master, weighed
down with official and other burdens in
Leipsic, to recall the delightful days in Potsdam
and live them over; but the recollection
of them was not a mere idle, dreamy revery;
all his deeper feelings were so engrossed with the
realities of his art that he did not hesitate to respond
to its exacting demands. He decided to reset
the theme which the King had given him with all the
skill of which he was capable. He completed the
task in a few weeks. In its new form the work
had thirteen numbers, finished with masterly ability.
He engraved it upon copper and dedicated it to
the King, with the title, &ldquo;Musical Offering, humbly
dedicated to His Majesty, King of Prussia.&rdquo; He
sent it to the King with the following characteristic
letter:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All Gracious King:&mdash;Herewith I present to Your
Majesty, with deepest respect, a musical offering, the noblest
part of which is from your own hand. I recall with the
highest pleasure the particular kingly grace with which,
during my stay in Potsdam, Your Majesty condescended to
give me a theme for a fugue on the piano, and to set me
the task of working it out at once in your presence. As a
subject, it was my duty to obey Your Majesty&rsquo;s command.
I soon realized, however, that because of lack of necessary
preparation, the execution was not up to the standard demanded
by such a theme. I then determined, and at once
set about it, to work out this royal theme more perfectly,
and then give it to the world. I have done this to the
extent of my ability, and with no other purpose than the
exaltation, though only in one small particular, of the glory
of a sovereign who must be admired by all in music, as well
as in war and the arts of peace. I make bold to add the
following respectful request,&mdash;that Your Majesty will deign
to honor this small work by graciously accepting it, and
continue Your Majesty&rsquo;s favor to Your Majesty&rsquo;s most
loyal subject and obedient servant,</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>While engaged upon this remarkable work, a new
joy brightened his home. His daughter Frederica<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a>
was engaged to Altnikol, one of his best beloved
scholars, who, upon Bach&rsquo;s warm commendation,
was given the lucrative position of organist and musical
director by the Council of Naumburg. This
enabled them to marry and have a home, thus lifting
another burden from the loving father. He could
contemplate the evening of life with serene hope.
His own were all provided for, and he now devoted
himself with all his powers to a work he had
long contemplated. The evening of life might
end in darkness, but now he was ready to go before
the throne of the All Highest, to whose
service he had devoted his art piously and faithfully
all his life.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>The great work which he had so much at heart
was &ldquo;Kunst der Fuge&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Art of Fugue&rdquo;),
a wonderful creation, unsurpassed in the abundance
of its contents and their development. In completely
elaborated numbers, not in dry theoretical
rules, he shows what a skilful composer may accomplish
with a single theme, and how it may be developed
in the form and according to the rules of strict
counterpoint in every possible way. So far as harmonious
combinations are concerned, each part is
exhaustively treated.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> In the closing fugue, beside
the two parts of the original theme, he introduces a
short but very striking theme of only four notes;
but those four notes represent the whole life of the
composer, with all its joys and sorrows, its divine
inspiration, and its deep soul-sadness&mdash;the four
notes, &ldquo;B-A-C-H.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a></p>
<p>Bach&rsquo;s labor upon this colossal work exhausted
what little strength he had. His eyesight began to
fail. His creative faculty was impaired. He could
no longer work. The &ldquo;Art of Fugue&rdquo; remained
unfinished. Philipp Emanuel added to the last bars
of his father&rsquo;s manuscript the sad words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While engaged on this fugue, in which the name
of &lsquo;Bach&rsquo; is introduced in counterpoint, the author
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. The old master did not live to finish
the work. The end was near at hand. Two
operations were performed upon his eyes, but they
failed to help him. His life passed into darkness
before death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>But he never lost courage. His spiritual vision
remained clear to the last, so that he beheld the
glory of his God whom he was so soon to meet.
In those last days, so full of pain and of sorrow over
the thought that he might lose his faculties completely,
he triumphed over sickness and death with
the help of that lofty, unwavering faith which had
been the inspiration of all his work. Almost with
his dying voice he dictated to his beloved Altnikol
the majestic chorale (&ldquo;Wenn wir in h&ouml;chsten
N&ouml;then sein&rdquo;):</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When, sunk in deepest misery,</p>
<p class="t0">To make escape we vainly try,</p>
<p class="t0">When earthly help in vain is sought,</p>
<p class="t0">And earthly counsels come to nought,</p>
<p class="t0">There still remains this one relief&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">That Thou dost hear our cry of grief,</p>
<p class="t0">And that our faithful trust in Thee</p>
<p class="t0">From earthly ills will set us free.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This trust, this deliverance did not fail him in
those last days of pain and sorrow, in the last hard
struggle. He rose triumphant over them, and the
Almighty Father&rsquo;s hand led him to a place in the
choir of angels and holy spirits who stand before the
throne in adoration, singing, &ldquo;Holy! Holy! is the
Lord! Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving,
and honor, and power, and might be unto our God, forever
and ever. Amen.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spitta&rsquo;s</i>

miles south of Gotha.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>After the death of his father and mother, Sebastian Bach was adopted by his
elder brother, Johann Christoph, the organist and music master at Ohrdruff, who
gave him his earliest lessons in singing and piano-playing.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a>Eisenach, a little town in Thuringia, was the birthplace of Sebastian Bach. It
is also famous for the Wartburg, which stands on one of the hills near the town,
where Luther lived at one time and translated the Bible into German, and as being
the scene of many of the song contests of the Minnesingers.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a>George Erdmann was a schoolfellow of Sebastian Bach and an excellent
musician, though in after life he followed other pursuits.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_5" href="#fr_5">[5]</a>The Amatis were a world-renowned family of violin-makers living at
Cremona, Italy, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The most famous
members of the family were Andrea A., died in 1577, the maker of the first
Violin; Nicola, 1568-1586; Antonio, 1589-1627, and Niccole, 1596-1684,
the last the great violin-makers of the family.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a>George B&ouml;hm, a countryman of Bach, was born at Goldbach in 1661.
He was one of the greatest organists of his time.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a>Reinken was born at Deventer in 1663 and died as organist of St. Katherine&rsquo;s
Church, in Hamburg, in 1722. He had remarkable talent both as player and
composer and was greatly esteemed by Bach.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a>The term &ldquo;motet&rdquo; is applied to church music set to Biblical texts for several
voices, of moderate length, and without instrumental accompaniment.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>A large and beautiful forest, containing a hunting-castle, within the jurisdiction
of L&uuml;neburg.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a>Veit Bach, the founder of the Bach family, was a baker at Presburg, on the
Danube. After leaving Hungary he settled in Wechmar, Thuringia, and carried
on his business there. He played the lute and, it is related, was so fond of it that
he used to play it while his corn was being ground. His son, Hans, was the first
of the Bachs to make music a profession.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>The Silbermanns were a distinguished family of piano and organ makers whose
instruments were highly prized in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The
most famous of this name was Gottfried (1683-1753), who lived at Freiburg.
He built forty-two organs and introduced the present piano, then known as &ldquo;hammer-clavier,&rdquo;
into Germany. Bartolomeo Cristofori, who died in Florence in
1731, undoubtedly invented this instrument and gave it its present name, piano-forte,
but Silbermann greatly improved it.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>Certain scholars in the institution, known as &ldquo;matin scholars,&rdquo; received
free instruction as compensation for their singing in the choir.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_14" href="#fr_14">[14]</a>An introduction to a chorale or fugue, and sometimes, as organists frequently
improvise on a chorale, a free fantasie. A fugue is generally preceded by a prelude
which stands in the same key.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_15" href="#fr_15">[15]</a>Reinken was born in 1623 and died in 1722. At this time he must have
been about seventy-seven years of age.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a>Clavicembalo was the name of the usual form of the piano in the sixteenth
century. It was the successor of the clavichord and the predecessor of the hammer-clavier.
It had various forms and names. In Germany it was called klavier and
sometimes monocordo, and in England spinet or virginal, according to its size or
shape. Cembalist is the equivalent of our word &ldquo;pianist.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_17" href="#fr_17">[17]</a>In its general sense, counterpoint is the art of combining melodies. It is
divided into two classes&mdash;plain and double.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_18" href="#fr_18">[18]</a>Spitta, in his Life of Bach, says: &ldquo;In former times Bach&rsquo;s grandfather had
had an appointment at the court of Duke Wilhelm IV at Weimar. This, however,
can hardly have been the cause of his grandson&rsquo;s being invited to the same
town. Other ties must have existed of which we know nothing, but which of
course would easily have been formed at Eisenach or Arnstadt.&rdquo; Bitter, in his Life,
says Bach probably owed the appointment to his numerous relatives in the Saxon
state.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_19" href="#fr_19">[19]</a>This organ was in use until 1863, when a fine new one took its place as
a memorial to Bach.

and died as director of the Conservatorio della Piet&agrave; in that city in 1743. His
works are very highly esteemed.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_21" href="#fr_21">[21]</a>Johann Pachelbel, a distinguished organist and one of the foremost promoters
of the organ style before Bach, was born at Nuremberg in 1653 and died there in
1706 as organist of St. Sebastian&rsquo;s Church.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_22" href="#fr_22">[22]</a>Dietrich Buxtehude, born at Helsing&ouml;r in 1637, was organist in 1668 at the
Marien Church, L&uuml;beck, and remained in that position until he died, May 9,
1707. He was one of the most learned organists and composers of the seventeenth
century, but most of his works have been lost.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_23" href="#fr_23">[23]</a>Maria Barbara was the youngest daughter of Johann Michael Bach. She was
at this time about twenty years of age and was a good musician. It is somewhat
singular that in the numerous family of Bachs, Sebastian was the only one who
took a Bach to wife.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_24" href="#fr_24">[24]</a>The
following notice was inserted by Stauber himself in the parish register:</div>
<div class="fncont">&ldquo;On October 17, 1707, the respectable Herr Johann Sebastian Bach, a bachelor
and organist to the church of St. Blasius at M&uuml;hlhausen, the surviving lawful
son of the late most respectable Herr Ambrosius Bach, the famous town-organist
and musician of Eisenach, was married to the virtuous maiden, Maria Barbara
Bach, the youngest surviving daughter of the late very respectable and famous artist,
Herr Johann Michael Bach, organist at Gehren; here in our house of God, by the
favor of our gracious ruler, after the banns had been read in Arnstadt.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_25" href="#fr_25">[25]</a>In the original:</div><div class="verse"><p class="t0">&ldquo;Jetzt komm ich, Herr, vor Deinen Thron</p><p class="t0">Mit loberf&uuml;lltem Munde,</p><p class="t0">Und danke Dir durch Deinen Sohn</p><p class="t0">In dieser Abendstunde.</p><p class="t0">Nimm an das Opfer, das ich Dir</p><p class="t0">Mit meinen Lippen bringe,</p><p class="t0">Und h&ouml;re gn&auml;dig was ich Dir</p><p class="t0">Zu Deiner Ehre singe.&rdquo;</p>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_30" href="#fr_30">[30]</a>The suite was originally a succession of various national dances. The four
most characteristic parts are the Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue.
Sometimes they also include the Gavotte, Passepied, Branle, Bourr&eacute;e, and Minuet.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_31" href="#fr_31">[31]</a>The Sonata (sounding piece) originally was the general term for instrumental
pieces, as opposed to Cantata (singing piece). The present form was definitely
established by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Its parts are Allegro, Andante or
Adagio, Minuet with trio or a Scherzo, and Rondo or Presto.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_32" href="#fr_32">[32]</a>Inventions, a term first used by Bach in the sense of impromptus. They
were small pieces for the piano, written in two or three parts, each developing
a single idea.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_33" href="#fr_33">[33]</a>Symphony (with sound) is a large musical work for full orchestra, in the
form of the sonata, with much fuller development of the single parts and richer
development of true color in particular instruments.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_34" href="#fr_34">[34]</a>The title which Bach gave to this work is as follows:</div>
<div class="fncont">&ldquo;The Well Tempered Clavier, or Preludes and Fugues in all the Tones and
Semi-tones, both with the major third or &lsquo;Ut, Re, Mi&rsquo; and with the minor third
or &lsquo;Re, Mi, Fa.&rsquo; For the Use and Practice of Young Musicians who desire to
learn, as well as for those who are already skilled in this study by way of amusement.
Made and composed by Johann Sebastian Bach, Chapelmaster to the Grand
Duke of Anhalt-C&ouml;then and Director of his Chamber Music. In the year 1722.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="fncont">The first part of the &ldquo;Well Tempered Clavier,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Clavichord,&rdquo; as it is usually
called, was written in 1722, probably during some of his journeys with Prince
Leopold. The second part was finished in Leipsic about 1740.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_35" href="#fr_35">[35]</a>June 25, 1722.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_36" href="#fr_36">[36]</a>The &ldquo;Alumni&rdquo; were charity children, who were provided with food and
lodging in the schoolhouse and a small allowance of money in consideration of their
singing in church and at funerals.

eldest daughter, Caroline Dorothea, born in 1708, survived her father. The eldest
son, Wilhelm Friedemann, was born in 1710. Carl Philipp Emanuel, the most
famous of the sons, was born in 1714. By the second wife he had thirteen children,
seven of whom were sons. Only two of them survived their father&mdash;Johann
Christoph Friedrich, born in 1732, died in 1795, and Johann Christian, born in
1735, died in 1782.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_41" href="#fr_41">[41]</a>It was Professor Gesner who wrote in one of his works upon ancient music:
&ldquo;I, my Fabius, who am in other respects an admirer of antiquity, am of opinion
that my Bach and others like him unite in their own persons many Orpheuses and
twenty Arions.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_42" href="#fr_42">[42]</a>Hohenfriedberg is a town in Silesia where Frederick the Great in 1745 defeated
the Austrians and Saxons under Prince Charles of Lorraine. In the same
year he defeated the Austrians at Sohr, in Bohemia; and 121 years later the
Prussians defeated the Austrians at the same place.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_43" href="#fr_43">[43]</a>Karl Heinrich Graun was born at Wahrenbr&uuml;ck, Saxony, in 1701, and died

passages such as are found at the end of concerto movements and arias.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_48" href="#fr_48">[48]</a>Elizabeth Juliana Frederica was born in 1726. Bach&rsquo;s first grandchild, the

He had been working with Altnikol only a few days before his death. An organ chorale, composed in a former time, was floating in his mind, ready as he was to die, and he wanted to complete and perfect it. He dictated and Altnikol wrote. &lsquo;Wenn wir in h&ouml;chsten N&ouml;then sein&rsquo; (&lsquo;Lord, when we are in direst need&rsquo;) was the name he had originally given it; he now adapted the sentiment to another hymn and wrote above it &lsquo;Vor Deinen Thron tret ich hiermit&rsquo; (&lsquo;Before Thy throne with this I come&rsquo;).&rdquo;

Prince of Anhalt-C&ouml;then, and Cantor to the School of St. Thomas in town, having
fallen calmly and blessedly asleep in God, his body has this day, according to
Christian usage, been consigned to earth.&rsquo; His grave was near the church, but
when, within this century, the graveyard was removed farther from the church and
the old site opened as a roadway, Bach&rsquo;s grave, with many others, was obliterated,
and it is now no longer possible to determine the spot where his bones were laid to
rest.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spitta&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;<i>Life of Bach</i>,&rdquo; Vol. III, p. 275.

<br /><span class="small">TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN BY</span></i>
<br /><span class="large">GEORGE P. UPTON</span></p>
<p class="center small"><i>A new, interesting, and very useful series that will be found especially
<br />suitable for school libraries and for supplementary reading</i></p>
<p>The books in this series are translated from the German, because
in that country a specialty is made of really desirable
reading for the young. Eight titles are now ready and more will
follow.</p>
<p>Their simplicity and accuracy make them very useful for every
school library in the grades.</p>
<p>For parents who feel disposed to give their children books that
provide a mild element of historical information, as well as first-class
entertainment, the little books will prove a veritable find.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;life-stories&rdquo; retain the story form throughout, and embody
in each chapter a stirring event in the life of the hero or the action
of the time. The dramatis person&aelig; are actual characters, and the
facts in the main are historically correct. They are therefore both
entertaining and instructive, and present biography in its most attractive
form for the young.</p>
<p class="center smaller">A FULL LIST OF THE TITLES IS GIVEN ON THE NEXT PAGE</p>
<p>The work of translation has been done by Mr. George P.
Upton, whose &ldquo;Memories&rdquo; and Lives of Beethoven, Haydn, and
Liszt, from the German of Max Mueller and Dr. Nohl, have been
so successful.</p>
<p class="center small"><i>Each is a small square 16mo in uniform binding, with four illustrations. Each 60 cents net.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;These narratives have been well calculated for youthful minds
past infancy, and Mr. Upton&rsquo;s version is easy and idiomatic.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Nation.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a delightful writer, clearness, strength, and sincerity marking
everything to which he puts his hand. He has translated these little
histories from the German in a way that the reader knows has conserved
all the strength of the original.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;They are written in simple, graphic style, handsomely illustrated,
and will be read with delight by the young people for whose benefit
they have been prepared.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The work of translation seems to have been well done, and these
little biographies are very well fitted for the use of young people....
The volumes are compact and neat, and are illustrated sufficiently but
not too elaborately.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Springfield Republican.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;These books are most entertaining and vastly more wholesome than
the story books with which the appetites of young readers are for the
most part satisfied.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Indianapolis Journal.</i></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
